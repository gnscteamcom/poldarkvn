WEBVTT

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.799
(Dog barks)

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.719
(Men chatting)

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.439
What did he bring?

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.839
A proposal...from Trencrom.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.479
Judas, Ross! Will you never learn?

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.959
Possibly not.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.959
You are about to stand trial
for being part ofthe smuggling run.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.919
I can't bear it all over again.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.879
So you can tell Trencrom,
till he offers to stand in court in your place,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.479
he can sling his proposals,
and his guineas,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.039
and his secret caches
off Damsel Point!

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.799
My money's on transportation.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.639
It's not essential. Elizabeth's already
unnerved by his involvement.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.399
Any form of discredit in court today will suffice.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.839
Hm... I admire your confidence.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.359
When one has laid the foundations,
one has every right to expect a result.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.039
(Bustle of market)

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.039
CLERK: Call Ross Poldark.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.679
Well, well.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.439
Here we are again.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.319
There are those who seem capable
of learning from their mistakes,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.359
and those who do not.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.199
Clearly you fall into the latter category.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.359
Mr Poldark?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.919
With the deepest respect, sir,
I beg to differ.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.679
- On what grounds?
- On the grounds that on the night in question,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.159
I was not at Nampara Cove,
but at St Ives.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.479
I can produce three witnesses
to swear to the fact.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.079
Customs officer Vercoe alleges
you were part ofthe smuggling operation,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.559
that you attacked him and broke his nose.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.559
I'm very sorry to hear
about Mr Vercoe's injuries, sir,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.999
but as my witnesses will testify,
the assailant could not possibly have been I.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.719
Aye, sir. It's true, sir.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.639
- Case dismissed.
- (Court murmurs)

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.559
Call Dwight Enys.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.239
I have perused your statement
and I find it singularly unconvincing.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.879
No educated man can suddenly
appear on a cliff edge

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.679
and start building a bonfire
without certain conclusions being drawn.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.479
What explanation can you offer?

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.559
- It was a cold night and my coat was thin.
- (Ripples of laughter)

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.599
Heavy responsibility rests upon
all men of reputation

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.239
to help stamp out the illegal conduct
oftheir less enlightened neighbours,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.759
not to encourage or participate in it.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.239
- What have you to say?
- Nothing that would convince you, sir.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.039
Fined £50 or three months' imprisonment.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.559
(Hushed) Sir.
Mr Trencrom offers to pay your fine, sir.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.959
Tell Mr Trencrom I thank him, but
I'm perfectly capable of paying my own fine.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.879
You should take his bounty, Dwight.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.399
- He looks afer his friends.
- Mr Trencrom is not my friend.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.479
- I did not go to all that trouble for his sake.
- No. For mine.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.039
- You know what I feel about that.
- You told me many times.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.279
- I am under an enduring debt.
- No.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.679
Enduring.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.319
So now it's all over,
when do you leave for Bath?

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.479
- I've no plans to do so.
- Your... Your wedding to Caroline.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.959
Is off. We were incompatible.
I see that now.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.839
It could never have lasted and...
it would have led to misery on both sides.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.759
What made you decide
to accept Trencrom's offer?

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.919
When a man's life is in tatters,
he can ill afford to be stubborn.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.559
I never thought I'd see the day.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.439
That I'd go to jail?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.559
That you'd play the penitent to avoid it.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.519
I played the game!
I thought that's what you wanted.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.719
Is there really no hope for Grace?

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.319
On Saturday our coal runs out.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.039
The engine will halt and so will
this whole dismal venture.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.359
I'm sorry for it.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.519
I'm sorry for many things.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.119
Our workers, our coffers...

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.479
- And most of all, I'm sorry for you.
- Nay, Ross.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.599
For selling my shares in a profitable mine
and sinking them into this utter folly.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.359
All I can say is this,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.479
- I'll never again be guilty of such recklessness.
- (Door opens)

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.439
Captain Henshawe to see you, sir.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.879
Captain Ross. Ma'am.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.279
Excuse the intrusion,
but I'd like for you to see something.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.919
What's that? The last of our coal?

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.799
- Ha! Tin.
- Tin?

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.079
From that shaft we're sinking
below the 60 fathoms.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.159
They come upon it today.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.919
Have you been down?
Is there any size to it?

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.439
Six foot and more across
and we don't yet know how deep.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.239
We've spent 18 months searching for copper

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.799
and you expect me to get excited
over a parcel oftin!

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.519
Who found it?

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.799
- Ted Carkeek and Paul Daniel.
- Hm...

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.119
And they think they've discovered
El Dorado!

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.479
I'd like for you to come
and see it for yourself.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.159
Trevithick reckons his engine
should last 50 years.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.879
No doubt he's right.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.039
Well, given the opportunity.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.759
- 'Tis worth a look, Captain.
- You'll not be disappointed.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.399
Will you be joining us below, ma'am?

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.999
No, I think not, but do take my assistant,
and make sure he reports back to me.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.199
(Demelza hums a tune)

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.759
- Betty!
- Ah. It's true?

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.919
A keenly lode found and the mine's saved?

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.679
I wish as much as you.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.079
I'll save my wishes for an easy birthing!

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.799
That is wishful thinking!

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.159
Hello!

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.599
Good day to you, ladies.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.879
Don't 'ee fear, Betty.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.679
If anyone can make it right, 'tis Dr Enys.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.999
Oh, what it is to be a miracle worker!

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.839
(Men's indistinct voices)

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.079
I agree...

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.879
It's not unimpressive.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.239
You said all along
you'd a feeling to go deeper.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.559
Yes, but for copper, not for tin.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.079
Anyway, it mayjust be the merest pocket.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.879
Bring up what you can.
It'll make a difference to your final earnings.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.439
We'd have given up more easily
without this find.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.039
I know that, Paul.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.839
But it's come too late to save us.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.879
'Tis a queer one, though.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.039
- Copper under tin you'd expect.
- But not tin under copper.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.919
To my mind what's needed is breathing space,
to see ifthis'll amount to anything.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.559
- I'd agree.
- How's that to happen?

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.919
I tell you, I don't have £20 in the world.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.919
Betty seems fair.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.719
I wish she were stronger.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.839
But then all these people are half-starved.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.239
She's braver than she looks.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.719
She wants me at the birthing.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.519
Though in truth, she's as well offwith you
and Mrs Zacky.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.599
It'd make her easier to know
she'll be tended by a man of learning.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.559
With little practical experience.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.879
It's not so. Look what you did for Rosina.
Was that not practical?

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.199
It was indeed.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.559
Has your knee given you trouble
since the ambush?

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.839
No, sir. And I'm that grateful.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.959
What would have happened
if 'ee hadn't come to help me?

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.559
Well, you'd be wed to Charlie!

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.559
Never knowed he was the informer.
'Tis better this way.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.999
Is it?

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.519
If you hadn't helped Rosina...

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.599
I'd be married, in a new town,
tending new patients, living a new life.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.879
Rosina's knee do have much to answer for!

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.119
It has saved me from myself, at any rate.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.279
(Gulls cry)

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.319
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.359
Dear  Dwight. I am returning your  letters
which I have fully digested

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.319
and in which I fond nothing
to make me regret my decision.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.679
Your preference for your patients
and friends is esteemable.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.959
Had it not been at my expense,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.279
I would not now be requesting you
to never  write to me again.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.719
But it was. So I do.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.559
Demelza?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.879
I've been meaning to call upon you,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.519
to thank you for your kindness
these past few months.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.239
In lending you my husband?

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.719
In a manner of speaking.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.159
Oh, you're welcome to him. Just so long as
you remember where he belong

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.919
and send him back to me
when you're done with him.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.599
Mistress Poldark!

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.119
Another escape for your husband in court.
What a charmed life he leads.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.879
It would appear so.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.079
- For you, young man.
- George, you must stop this.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.359
Oh, cannot a man spoil his godson?

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.679
This new find, what will it mean?

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.439
In a word...

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.639
..nothing.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.279
Perhaps ifwe'd struck a massive bed oftin,
requiring minimum outlay

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.799
and promising a quick return...

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.959
Tin do fetch less than copper?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.159
Considerably.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.239
And besides, what good would it do?

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.679
The tin industry is much depressed.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.439
Pity.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.759
But there it is.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.639
Did I mention that I saw Horace Treneglos
at the market?

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.479
No. Is he well?

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.319
He sends his compliments...

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.159
..and say that it's a shame that you've sold
all of your shares in Wheal Leisure.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:00.239
I said that he must be mistaken.
For surely if you had, you'd have told me.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.239
I've been meaning to mention this
for some time.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.159
But not quite sure how to begin.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.759
As you know, Francis sank his last £600
into Wheal Grace.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.239
Yes...

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.839
And when he died, he left Elizabeth
with...considerable debts.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.039
To relieve her poverty,
I...bought all his shares at Wheal Grace

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.919
through a third party,
knowing she would not accept the money.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.159
- But why should you...
- Because I felt under a burden of obligation,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.559
to Francis and his family...

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.479
..which is now discharged.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.759
Of course, at the time we had Trencrom's
money coming in, but since the ambush...

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.159
Are you angry?

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.959
- That you help Elizabeth?
- And Geoffrey Charles.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.919
And leave Jeremy and me
to fend for ourselves?

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.279
You have me to fend for you.
They have no one.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:13.359
Are you sure? From what I hear,
George is being very obliging.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.519
Hm... Doubtless he would be...

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.319
..if Elizabeth would let him.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.039
But she will not.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.199
George's ambition before Francis died

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.919
was to drive a wedge between our two families.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.479
And the easiest way to do it
was by befriending theirs.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.959
By helping Elizabeth,
he is merely continuing the same tactics.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.759
- Yes, Ross.
- Although it wasn't my aim in helping her,

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.039
it does have the effect of strengthening
her hand against him.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.319
Yes, Ross.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.279
- Mistress Demelza?
- Who be that, then...

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.279
..coming across the fields?

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.759
Betty Carkeek! 'Tis 'er time!

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.399
And Dr Enys can't be found!

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.279
Ross! Fetch me the brandywine!

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.959
Calm yourself. We'll go, we'll go.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.719
Now you stay here, Jeremy.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.879
Thank you.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.239
Come here. Come here. Whoa!

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.679
- Hurry!
- Sir!

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.279
Captain, er...who is it?

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.439
..er...Henshawe, asking for you.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.159
Your mine, whatever.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.239
Here. Take him.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.999
Won't be long.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.359
(Pained cry of labour)

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.719
Betty, I've brought you something for the pain.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.039
I found him, Betty! Dr Enys be here.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.079
(Wails)

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.239
We've opened her up a tidy bit
these past days.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.399
The last we brought up,
'tis as rich as I'd ever seen.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.319
Ross?

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.799
More and more it go against the grain
to let her fill up with water,

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.519
knowing what's down there.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.559
It goes against the grain at any time!

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.639
- But without coal to keep the pump working...
- That's what I'm thinking.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.559
I could put down £100.
It would see us through another month.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.599
You'd be willing to do that?
After all our failures?

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.759
In a day or so, we'll know better.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.639
If nothing comes of it, we can close
and I'll have lost £20.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.959
With your permission,
I'll send out for more coal.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.239
By all means, send out!

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.399
(Chuckles)

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.119
- (Pained cry of labour)
- It'll be a boy, that's for sure.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.079
They's trouble even before they're born.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.959
Push. Push, Betty. Push.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.319
(She wails)

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.279
(Baby cries)

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.319
Ssh. Ssh.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.039
Betty, 'ee'll never guess!
There's news of Grace!

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.199
And a fine new Carkeek boy!

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.039
What news of Grace?

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.199
- She's to stay open another month.
- 'Tis a present we never looked for!

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.159
God willing the lode should hold
and I'll be able to feed my family!

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.359
- To young Master Carkeek!
- And tin!

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.959
And tin!

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.599
God bless 'ee, sur.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.679
Bless Captain Henshawe.
He's our saviour.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.359
(Door opens)

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.799
This is becoming an obsession.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.119
Are you planning on joining the Army?

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.479
Why would I do that when I have battlefronts
of my own at home?

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.039
Hm...

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.519
Which reminds me.
Have those forces been deployed yet?

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.319
Hm. As per  your  instructions.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.679
Don't frown, dear.
A wrinkled brow is not becoming.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.839
I'm at my wits' end with Tabb.
He contradicts everything I say

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.799
as if he thinks he is master here now!

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.399
And now these letters have come, all these
questions, which apparently only I can answer.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.399
A tithe of£1 and 6 shillings on the seines
of certain fishing boats in Sawle.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.959
"Should the fishermen be pressed for money?"
I don't know! Should they?

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.479
Can I afford not to press them?

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.639
Whose need is greater?

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.399
- Dear God, is there no end to it?
- What is it?

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.039
Who are these people?

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.039
Tinners, exercising their rights
under stannary law to prospect for tin.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.519
But this is outrageous!

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.519
Vulgars permitted by law
to violate the purlieu of a gentleman's estate?

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.919
How can such a thing be lawful?

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.119
(Starts coughing) It's monstrous!

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.479
(Splutters) Monstrous!

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.639
(Coughs and gasps)

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.599
No sign of it petering out?

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.239
Far from it.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.279
You know I'm not one to raise hopes,

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.439
but it could be significant.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.919
(Tapping and hammering)

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.399
The damage is considerable.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.959
She'll need constant care
for the foreseeable future,

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.919
possibly the rest of her life.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.599
But...we cannot afford a nurse.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.239
Who is to provide...

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.119
Me.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.759
I must be the one to take care of her.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.199
Who's to take care of me?
I was here first!

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.199
I must speak to Ross.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.879
You'll get no sympathy from that quarter!
He was never a fan ofyour mother!

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.319
Is there no one else you can turn to?

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.159
I came as soon as I could.
How is she?

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.079
Very bad. Dr Enys fears
she may never recover.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.039
You must know how that grieves me.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.439
I know how fond you are of her.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.919
- Do you know what I wish?
- No.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.959
That you allow me
to make the arrangements,

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.839
engage a separate establishment for her
here at Trenwith

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.959
- so no further burden need fall on you.
- I couldn't let you do that.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.119
You're so frail. You try to be strong,
but now it is you who need care.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.119
- Let me provide it.
- You're very kind, George.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.959
But I'm stronger than I look.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.799
I will have to be.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.719
- One must take what life sends.
- But not what I send?

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.439
- You've already given so much.
- For my godson, a few trifles.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.279
For yourself, nothing.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.039
At least let me help your dear mother.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.479
(Elizabeth sighs)

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.639
Your generosity makes me ashamed
to refuse you anything.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.919
Well, ifthere was one thing
you did not...refuse me,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.359
it would solve everything.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.479
What's that?

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.239
Yourself.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.279
Before you speak, let me add one thing.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.959
You must be aware how long I've loved you,

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.079
serving you only as I could,
paying back Francis's card debts,

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.279
allowing no thought of retaliation
when he persistently insulted me.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.679
Since his death, I've served you
any way you allowed,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.119
and will continue to do so,
whether or not I stand to gain by it.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.839
- I'm more than grateful...
- But now I ask you to marry me.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.439
I say that I love you.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.399
I don't flatter myselfthat you love me.
I think you might like and respect me.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.119
I hope in time that liking might become
something more.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.999
- But...
- I cannot bring you breeding,

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.359
but I can bring a kind of gentility

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.719
which is all the more punctilious
for being only a generation deep.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.639
- As for material considerations...
- Please!

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.119
You would never marry for money. If you did,
you would not be who I know you to be.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.399
But at the risk of offending,
let me be clear about what I can offer.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.679
My house is four times the size of Trenwith.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.639
I have 20 servants, a park of 500 acres,
my own carriage, a phaeton.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.719
You could have one too.
Or three or four.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.399
I'd take you to London or Bath.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.359
You'd wear the finest clothes,
the rarestjewels,

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.159
mix with the best in society.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.119
As my adopted son,
Geoffrey Charles would be my heir.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.599
For so long you have lived in a cage.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.959
Will you not allow me to give you the key?

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.199
Oh, George...

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.359
I don't know what to say.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.799
Say nothing, my dear.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.519
I don't ask for an answer now.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.479
I only ask permission to give.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.479
It's just...that I feel so alone.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.039
Loneliness is not one-sided, Elizabeth.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.199
A man may feel it too.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:27.919
Especially when he has loved as long
and as devotedly as I have.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.879
And the devil taketh him up into
an exceedingly high mountain

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.119
and showeth him all the kingdoms ofthe world,

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.639
and sayeth, "All these things I will give thee."

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.759
Yes, Aunt. All these things and more besides.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.479
A fortune for my boy
to make up for the one his father lost.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.759
And what is he expecting in return?
A heart?

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.519
Is he aware that you have none to give,

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.959
having long ago bestowed it elsewhere?

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.439
- How soon till we need timbers?
- Timbers cost.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.159
- But without them?
- You know as well as I do.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.999
Is it a risk we're willing to take?

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.479
It's a risk we've been taking for some time now.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.039
We've shored it up the best we can.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.959
We'd sooner 'ee spend money on coal,
to keep the pump going.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.799
There isn't a mine in existence
wouldn't take the same chance.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.199
- That's a pretty piece.
- I made it from an old one of Ross's.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.959
I shall wear it tonight.
We're expecting visitors.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.039
- Do I know 'em?
- One of 'em you even like.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.799
Huh...

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.439
You grew up here?

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.319
'Tis a veritable galleon
compared to my father's humble sloop.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.719
Aye aye, Captain.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.559
- Or should I say Admiral?
- My father.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.759
Charles William Poldark.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.439
Then he is my grandfather by proxy,
since you are my commanding officer,

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.239
- Stepmama!
- (They giggle)

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.839
Elizabeth, my dear, how are you?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.479
May I introduce my stepson?
Midshipman James Blamey.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.399
My sister-in-law Elizabeth Poldark.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.959
Your servant, ma'am.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.799
Close the hatch, dear.
We don't want to be catching flies.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.599
- Well, Elizabeth...
- Well, cousin, how good of you to come.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.599
AGATHA: Is that little Verity?

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.879
Bring her to me this minute!

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.079
Cutlass at the ready? (Giggles)

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.359
Had I known of your mother's condition,
we'd not have dreamed of intruding.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.519
How difficult it must be for you.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.639
It was at first.
But now she has a nurse and a maid.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.279
Is that not expensive?

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:58.439
How strange it must be for you here,
without Francis.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.279
No more than for you.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.319
I've had to grow used to it.
For Geoffrey Charles's sake.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.079
And can you?

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.639
For my son, I must do whatever's necessary.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.959
And that, boy,
is how you put the Navy in its place!

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.519
Your great-aunt is a fiend at French Ruff.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.919
- Obviously I let her win.
- Obviously.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.279
We're expected at Nampara.
You'll go with us.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.999
Oh... I...

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.039
Yes, Elizabeth?

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.999
I have a headache.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.839
Did Elizabeth not wish to join you?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.479
She's distressed over her mother's illness.
She sends her apologies and love.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.919
Mistress Poldark's a thing of beauty,
do you not think?

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.679
Were I five years older,
I'd throw myself at her feet.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.679
- She'd very likely trample you underfoot!
- (Chuckles)

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.199
On our way over I noticed the engine chimney
ofthe mine still smoking.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.359
We continue to limp on, existing on
a shoestring, everything against us.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.759
Not entirely! Tin has been found.
We're not sure how far or deep it goes, but...

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.159
The quality ofthe ore is promising, I admit it.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.559
I'm very glad for you.
A change in your fortune is long deserved.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.079
You keep a very fine ship, Captain.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.599
- Do you have your own cabin?
- Naturally. Would you care to inspect it, sir?

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.559
So I should!

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.519
Do you see much of Elizabeth?

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.879
She don't seem inclined to visit us now.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.439
But she's happy enough to admit Ross, or was.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.479
Why do you ask?

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.159
I don't know, there's something...
I cannot put my finger on it.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.239
She seems a little on edge,
as if innerly excited.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.279
- And I got the impression...
- Yes?

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.279
..that she thinks her circumstances
are about to change.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.639
Oh...

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.799
Do you know why that might be?

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.319
Perhaps you should ask Ross.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.679
Sounds a little bitter.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.119
Do it?

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.199
I only meant he sees more of her than I.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.079
I know he did love her.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.959
So when he goes to see her, I...

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.479
I'd not be human if I didn't wonder
what they say to each other

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.239
or...ifthey still have feelings.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.119
Do you think they do?

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.719
They were each other's first love.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.959
Such a love cannot easily be put aside.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.839
- But you have no reason to think...
- No reason, just...

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.639
Ross would never mean to hurt me.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.119
But I think if it came to a choice
between me and Elizabeth,

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.159
and with Elizabeth now free...

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.239
You cannot believe that!

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.959
Your ship is the Thunderer?

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.039
The frigate Hunter now, under Admiral Gell.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.879
We're in Plymouth Sound at present,
but under sailing orders next week.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.319
I'm monstrous glad of it.
I'd not want the war to end

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.759
before I've had the chance
to pepper the Frenchies!

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.559
Oh, I'm sure there'll be plenty of opportunity
for glory before the war is out.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.199
(Door opens)

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.719
Oh. Erm... My apologies.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.599
No, no. Come in. Join us.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.639
May I introduce midshipman James Blamey?

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.719
My good friend, Dr Dwight Enys.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.159
- Your servant, sir.
- And yours, sir.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.719
If you ever tire of life ashore,
consider us poor souls in the fleet.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.639
We're in dire need of good surgeons.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.679
- Is that so?
- Honour and glory beckon.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.239
As well as blood and gore.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.999
Honour and glory I can do without.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.439
But a mission, somewhere useful,
to direct my energies.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.759
- We can surely provide that.
- And a good skirmish as a fine distraction.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.399
- The point is, to do something.
- I agree.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.479
Idleness allows us too much time to think.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.919
What a treasure is James.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.679
He's like the west wind,
all gusty and clean and kind.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.599
- And he adores you!
- And I him, as if he were my own son.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.319
Oh, Verity, I'm that glad.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.399
It'll make up for...

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.959
For what?
My not having a child of my own?

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.439
Oh, but that's the most wonderful thing.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.919
There is nothing to make up for!

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.879
- Verity, when?
- About October!

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.039
(Both laugh happily)

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.039
(Demelza sighs)

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.999
Is it Verity's news which keeps you awake?

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.839
I think so.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.079
I can't imagine what else it could be.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.959
No, I don't suppose you can.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.719
I got the impression that she thinks
her  circumstances are about to change.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.719
(Cockerel crows)

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.399
Is it not dangerous, Captain,
riding when you're not recovered?

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.199
You leave me no choice.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.199
I was hoping you'd visit me as I convalesce.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.999
Or else that I'd receive an invitation to visit you.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.279
- Well, last time you came without an invitation.
- That was in the course of duty.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.759
This is in the pursuit of pleasure.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.279
Well, as you can see, my husband is not here.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.239
Are you sure ofthat?

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.519
On my previous visit,
you told me he was from home,

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.639
yet we both know he was somewhere
about the house.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.399
- Do we?
- Indeed.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.719
I thought it probable,
if I posted a watch long enough,

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.479
we'd discover where he was hiding.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.439
And did you post such a watch?

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.319
- Oh... (Laughs) I did not.
- Why?

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.639
I have too great a regard for you, ma'am.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.079
In truth, my heart was not in it.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.279
I'm a soldier, not a spy.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.559
I hold nothing against Captain Poldark,

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.799
except he married so charming a wife.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.399
So I trust you hold nothing against me
for what I did.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.199
Indeed.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.119
I'm obliged to you for what you did not do.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.159
So now I'm forced to venture out
for company and gossip.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:27.159
So what can you tell me? What news of
your cousin-in-law, Mistress Elizabeth?

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.239
I am sure I've heard nothing.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.319
I'd have thought you of all people would know.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.919
And what do you hear?

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.479
Only that Sir Hugh Bodrugan,
who shares a tailor with a certain person,

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.399
tells me that certain person
has just ordered his wedding clothes.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.759
Judas, who's that?

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.999
Can you not guess?

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.119
Why, George Warleggan!

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.879
Had you no idea?

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.119
No. Um... Well, that is a...

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.959
Yes, I did somewhat suspicion.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.719
No doubt you'll be able to ask him yourself
at the ball.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.999
The ball?

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.759
Sir Hugh is to hold a ball in a week's time.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.559
I hope you'll favour me with the ecossaise.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.199
Yes, of course.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.239
Well, thank you for calling, Captain McNeil.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.559
I must go and check on Jeremy.
Pray excuse me.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.479
(Laughs excitedly)

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.559
What ails 'ee, maid?

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.199
George Warleggan is to marry Elizabeth.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.279
Mr Ross will be surprised.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.959
Mr Ross mustn't be told.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.559
He'll find out soon enough,
but it won't be from me.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.319
(Hammering and chipping)

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.559
(Birds caw and waves crash in distance)

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.399
DWIGHT:
Fresh air, and whatever fruit you can get.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.079
Phthisis and scurvy.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.879
No wonder you've had your fill.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.879
I confess, a new challenge would suit me.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.319
A war would certainly supply that.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.679
You're not tempted yourself?

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.879
If duty calls, I won't ignore it.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.599
But I know enough of combat
not to relish it.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.079
Whereas I can almost hear the cannons
as we speak.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.319
- Look here, Ted.
- See how far we can cut it back.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.159
(Crumbling)

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.959
(Ominous rumbling)

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.879
(Rumbling intensifies)

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.159
- She's coming down!
- Run! Run!

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.239
(Horse whinnies in distance)

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.479
(Faint cries)

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.319
Run, run! Go!

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.479
(Distant rumbling)

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.199
(Rocks falling, men shouting)

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.879
(Distant shouts, horse whinnies)

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.119
How many? How many?

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.519
It's Paul and Ted!

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.199
There's one here!

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.479
Paul!

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.159
(Groans)

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.239
- Who's unaccounted for?
- Dan Curnow and Ted Carkeek.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.199
We don't stop until they're found.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.319
Forgive my intrusion. I thought to bring you
the news before you heard elsewhere.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.199
There's been an accident at Wheal Grace.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.119
- Your cousin-in-law...
- Is dead?

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.319
Is very much alive.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.319
Only the poor souls who labour for him
have paid the price.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.199
What happened?

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.559
What inevitably happens
when corners are cut

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.079
and safety is abandoned in favour of profit.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.999
I can scarce believe it.
Ross, of all people?

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.399
He's a desperate man.
One can only feel for his wife and child,

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:28.839
innocent casualties of his overwhelming hubris
now condemned to a life of penury.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.599
But forgive me for keeping you
from your dear relations.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.279
The Devil!

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.919
I hope you know what you're doing!

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.199
(Clanking and grinding of machinery)

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.959
Where's Ted?

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.839
Dwight!

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.799
How is he?

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.919
He was buried too long.
I can't bring him back.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.199
There's nothing you can do here, Ross.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.799
Help the others.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.399
- One dead.
- Two.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.359
- And five more badly injured.
- I'm to blame.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.999
- Nay, Ross.
- Betty!

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.479
- I should've ordered timbers.
- We all knew the risks.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.119
Grace is mine.
I should have insisted.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.919
Ted?

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.079
20 fathoms of pumping gear have gone.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.999
Six weeks or more to clear the debris.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.799
200 won't even do it
even ifwe each had the capital.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.959
Even then I wouldn't attempt it.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.799
This mine has cost three lives!

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.119
It was an ill-conceived venture from the start.
It will never open again.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.119
(Betty sobs)

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.999
My dear  Ross.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.039
I do not know how to write this letter
or to tell you what I have to say...

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.679
Are you ahead?

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.879
I've already won.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:33.399
- I've secured the hand ofthe woman I love.
- Elizabeth Poldark.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.599
And in so doing, I deal the deadliest blow
to my bitterest enemy.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.439
I see I must congratulate you.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.599
Oh, I congratulate myself.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.439
It's not given to many to achieve...

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.519
so much at a single stroke.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.039
Sometimes I don't know my own strength.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.959
What is it?

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.719
Sir Hugh Bodrugan,

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.679
inviting us to a ball.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:37.359
- Oh...
- Obviously we'll decline.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.519
Of course.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.879
Letter come from Trenwith.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.959
Thank you, Prudie.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.799
ELIZABETH:
I know what I have to say will distress you,

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.359
and I, who gave you so much pain once before,

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:32.759
would do almost anything than
to hurt you again and in the same way.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.959
Yet it seems I must.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.199
Oh, Ross, my life has been very frustrating,

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.319
and since Fr ancis died,
a lonely and an empty one.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.119
Perhaps I am the wrong sort of person
to be left alone.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.799
I seem to need the strength and protection
only a man can give.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.399
I have agreed to marry George Warleggan.

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.839
- I'm going to Trenwith.
- No, Ross!

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.479
- I must speak with Elizabeth.
- Ross, you can't!

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.279
Do you know what this is?

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.039
Is it about George?

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.039
- You knew?
- I heard rumours.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.799
- You didn't think to tell me?
- And have my head snapped off?

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.719
This thing must be stopped!

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.239
How? You can't stop it!

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.679
- Perhaps you don't want me to stop it.
- Perhaps I don't.

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.799
And especially not like this.

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.879
- Like what?
- Whatever it is you intend.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.479
How do you know what I intend?

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.039
How do I know anything, Ross?
How do I know you?

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.239
And yet I think I do.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:56.399
- Please get out of my way.
- Ross, don't go there tonight.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.039
- Wait until tomorrow.
- Please...get out...of my way.

00:49:40.960 --> 00:50:07.159
Elizabeth!

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.959
(Approaching footsteps)

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.559
Ross!

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.319
I came to pay my respects.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.799
And to thank you...for your letter.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.759
- Perhaps tomorrow morning...
- No.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.479
Not tomorrow. Now.

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.359
Downstairs, then.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.519
I'll get a candle.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.879
- Ross, I don't think...
- ..I should be in here.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.719
There is no one to consider but you and I.

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:01.839
Ross...

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.879
I so hated having to send you that letter,

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.479
but really, I've said all there is to be said.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.839
I disagree.
Perhaps you could clarify something for me.

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.559
- George Warleggan...
- Yes?

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.239
..a man I consider my greatest enemy.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.199
And you...

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.519
I've long considered my greatest friend.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.599
In which particular am I most adrift?

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.519
It's not as simple as that, Ross.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:32.319
Of course I'm proud and happy
to think of you as my greatest friend.

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:33.959
Oh, well,

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.799
it was more than that as I recall.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.039
Did you not tell me barely 12 months ago

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.399
that you had made a mistake
in marrying Francis?

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.799
That you realised quite soon
that it was I you had always loved?

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:50.679
Do you think I would have said those words
had I known what would happen to Francis?

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.559
And yet they cannot be unsaid.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.399
I felt you needed to know.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.839
That if you were unhappy in those early days,

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.919
then so was I,
that the mistake was not yours, but mine.

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.479
That mistake, as you call it,

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.439
has cost many people dear -

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:10.439
Francis, yourself, myself.

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.399
What mistake are you making now?

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:17.799
- I don't expect you to understand.
- Try me.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.839
George has been so good to me
since Francis died. So kind.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.359
Do you marry a man out of gratitude?

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.479
No. Notjust that.

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.879
You're wrong to think of him
as your greatest enemy.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.319
- The man who tried to get me hanged?
- I don't believe he intended that.

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:36.799
And now I think I can help mend the breach
between you.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.639
Are you marrying him for his money?

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.479
How dare you?

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.599
God knows I've made mistakes in my life, Ross.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.879
But I've tried to be loyal
to the people I care for,

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:52.919
and what seems like disloyalty to you now
is actually loyalty to my son!

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.159
What do you suggest for me?

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.679
30 years ofwidowhood and loneliness?

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.319
Can you offer me anything else?

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.879
Do you?

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.879
Do you love George?

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.599
- Yes.
- Why do I not believe you?

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.119
Why does this remind me ofwhen
you said you loved Francis?

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:18.159
You asked me, would I condemn you
to 30 years ofwidowhood?

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.959
Why would I need to?

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.119
You could have your pick of 30 men!

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.199
But I won't see you condemned to George!

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.119
Please leave now, Ross.

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.679
I'm my own mistress
and I will not be instructed.

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.679
I'm sorry you feel like this but I cannot help it.

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:36.239
Oh, you've never been able to help anything,
have you? It's all beyond your control,

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:40.039
full of good intentions,
leaving a trail of havoc in your wake.

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.919
Perhaps you can't help this either.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.879
I oppose this marriage, Elizabeth. I'd be glad of
your assurance you will not go through with it.

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:56.959
We both know you don't love him!

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.799
I love him to distraction
and will marry him next month!

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.199
Ross!

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.679
You're hateful, horrible. I detest you!

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.759
No, you don't.
You never have and you never will.

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.959
You would not dare! You would not dare!

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.159
I would, Elizabeth. I would.

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.479
And so would you.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.759
(Jeremy cries)

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.679
- T'ain't right.
- T'ain't fair.

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.159
- T'int fit.
- T'int.

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:03.079
(Infant cries)

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.799
I must go before the household wakes.

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.919
- What shall we...
- I must think.

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.999
- When will you...
- Soon.

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.399
(Cockerel crows)

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.959
(Cantering horse approaches)

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.639
What can I say?

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:11.199
It was something...I cannot explain.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.919
You must see I had no choice!

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.359
Nor I.
