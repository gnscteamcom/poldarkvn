WEBVTT

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.119
ROSS: Mr Vercoe.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.079
Cap'n Poldark.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.039
- May I ask where these men are headed?
- Truro Gaol, sir.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.799
And their crime?

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.759
Importing goods
without paying the required duty.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.479
Some call it "Free Trading".

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.079
Some call it
the only way to afford life's necessities.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.599
Brandy? Gin? These essentials, are they?

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.119
Salt is.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.639
'Tis my duty to enforce the law, Cap'n.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.599
Your commitment is heartwarming.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.199
Move out'a.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.199
Shouldn't rile 'im.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.999
Couldn't resist.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.879
I'm wanted at the mine.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.719
I have fuses to set.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.759
And you'd abandon me?

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.919
Suppose I met a footpad on the way home?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.879
God help him.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.999
(Gulls crying)

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.239
(Distant explosion)

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.719
(Coughing)

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.919
Still not through?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.559
Can't be far off.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.079
Can almost smell Trevorgie,
t'other side ofthat ironstone.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.119
Another blast should do the trick.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.079
- Will the shareholders keep faith with us?
- They're sensible men, most ofthem.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.839
And I intend to make a robust argument.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.879
So...we carry on?

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.199
We carry on.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.119
(Grunting)

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.839
- They've broken through?
- Almost.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.079
Ross Poldark is tenacious.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.839
(Grunting)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.599
Ultimately, I expect Wheal Leisure
to do very well for me.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.079
Well, why else would 'ee buy shares in it?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.399
On whose land does Wheal Leisure sit?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.439
Who is its main shareholder?

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.799
And his latest scheme
is about to come to fruition.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.159
- It's just too easy.
- (Grunting)

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.119
Were you hurt in the blast?

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.639
'Tis bruisin' I have all the time,
swelling too, same as Ted.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.319
Sir.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.519
- What is it?
- Like a plague, Ross.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.239
- Halfthe mine's afflicted.
- Halfthe village beside.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.599
Should we send these men home?

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.919
They can't afford to lose their pitches.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.239
Well, they won't, of course, but we need them fit.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.199
Get Dwight Enys.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.399
Dwight Enys is a scoundrel.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.719
For all he knows, I might be dead.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.359
I think I would have informed him,
had that been the case.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.119
CAROLINE: "DrEnys,
having saved my life some months ago,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.799
you appearto have
no further interest in my recovery.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.519
I would nonetheless esteem it a favour
if you would call

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.759
to assure yourself of my full recovery
and to receive payment for your skill.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.799
Unless, of course,
you have more important matters to attend."

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.359
Lift your head up.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.879
(Coughing)

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.679
Show me your teeth.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.439
I can't account for these symptoms.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.519
Swelling, bruising, bleeding gums,
listlessness...

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.759
Is it the dust? The foul air ofthe mine?

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.759
I wondered that,
but some ofthese people are fisherfolk.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.399
It's perplexing.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.559
(Coughing)

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.359
(Hums merrily)

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.559
♪ The summer and the May, oh

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.279
♪ For winter is a-come, oh...

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.479
Is that wise...

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.959
with the current so strong hereabouts?

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.679
I know 'em well enough.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.959
Will Ross be happy?

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.679
He'll be happy wi' these.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.719
And who's to tell him where I got 'em?

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.199
- How long will Jud be gone?
- Don't talk to me ofthat slinkin' g'eat lurker.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.839
Any excuse to shirk his chores an' study
the inside o' Sally Chill-off's kiddley.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.519
"Keeping 'is head down," he says.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.559
I'll keep 'is head down!

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.239
Could someone have caused the bruises?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.119
She says they come oftheir own accord,
but how?

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.759
I can't fathom it.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.759
Is it Paludal fever? Is it purpura?

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.519
I've tried...fresh air, sunlight,
goat's milk, nutmeg...

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.239
Perhaps what I should try is
a different profession.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.999
The navy, perhaps?

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.639
You'd enjoy ships' rations -

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.119
salt pork, dried biscuit, weevils...

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.919
No doubt and be all the healthier for it.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.039
Of course.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.839
What?

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.079
Biscuit, salt, no fresh fruit, no green vegetables.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.079
I thank you, Ross.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.719
What for?

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.999
Helping me diagnose the complaint.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.799
Scurvy.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.679
Cap'n Poldark, sir?

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.959
Thank you, sir.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.799
Dwight, this just came for you...

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.479
..from Killewarren.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.119
(Horse whinnies)

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.999
You seem in haste, George.
Have you urgent business afoot?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.039
- All my business is urgent.
- Including your assault-by-proxy?

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.639
- Excuse me?
- My servant, a witness at the trial,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.199
- was attacked and left for dead.
- How is that my concern?

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.759
Only that it would be a mistake to imagine such
intimidation could continue to be one-sided.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.919
Is that a threat, Ross? Is it?

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.439
(Cockerel crows)

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.119
Las' night in Sawle,
they say another drop was ambushed.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.039
More cargo lost
and four more sent to Bodmin Gaol.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.799
Since the riots in Bodmin,
the district's been crawling wi' soldiers.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.919
They'm clean out of salt
from Padstowe to St Ives.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.319
It do bode ill for when the shoals come in.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.839
- Fish won't keep.
- Fish won't sell.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.999
JINNY: Mam says if it weren't for Mr Ross...

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.359
Where are these from?

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.279
Nampara Cove.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.159
You went out in the boat?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.719
No, I whistled and they came a-dancin'
out the waves.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.039
Have you no sense?

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.879
Yes and an extra mouth to feed.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.119
Then at least do the courtesy of
taking more care of yourself in future.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.999
I won't be home late.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.759
(Door opens)

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.959
(Door slams)

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.119
AUNT AGATHA: What's that contraption?

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.919
ELIZABETH: A Virgula divinitoria.
It's believed to sniff out metal.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.039
AUNT AGATHA: Since they reconciled, I was
hoping Francis would look to Ross for guidance.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.039
Mm.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.919
That upstart Warleggan hasn't called of late.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.759
He and Francis have quarrelled.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.919
I wonder he doesn't call in your loans.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.319
Perhaps he has another plan.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.959
Such as?

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.559
Should I know how the Devil's mind works?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.559
You'd better keep him sweet.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.359
Perhaps you should pay him a visit.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.399
I've no influence over George.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.919
I've summoned Dr Choake
to come and visit you.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.199
I find myself in excellent health, thank you, Aunt,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.519
and I will improve further when we have
a working mine to our name

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.679
and are no longer reliant on Warleggan charity.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.279
Little Verity should be here.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.439
She'd know what to do.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.479
- Will you join me aboard next week?
- People will think me a bad wife,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.399
always gallivanting off
and sunning myself in Lisbon.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.119
That makes you a good wife,
for acceding to your husband's wishes.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.199
I think they are yours too.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.359
- You know they are.
- (Chuckles)

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.999
I've had word from James.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.319
- Oh?
- His ship was diverted to Penang.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.359
- And Esther?
- Remains with her governess in Plymouth.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.999
But, when James returns,
they will both come and visit us.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.479
I shall insist.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.759
Do you ever think the price was too high?

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.679
Your children shun us.
My brother disowns us.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.079
Well, we have at least one friend,
to whom we owe everything.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.359
Of course we're happy.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.399
I could not be more so.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.279
And yet?

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.319
My brother will not forgive me
and Andrew's children decline to meet me.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.959
Not that I blame them.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.879
I've replaced their dear, departed mother.
They must hate me.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.479
- When they meet you...
- I fear that will never happen.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.639
Ifthey will not accept me, how much worse will
it be ifAndrew and I have a child of our own?

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.479
Are you...?

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.359
No. Not yet.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.439
But children are the natural consequence
of marriage, are they not?

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.599
It would appear so.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.439
DWIGHT: "Dear Madam, I am happy to hear
of your recovery but be assured, as to payment,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.239
I am amply recompensed by
the knowledge of your gratitude".

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.479
"To you, Dr Enys, no doubt the saving of my life
seems a very small service.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.519
To me, it assumes a slightly greater
significance. I therefore enclose a guinea,

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.519
which is the smallest value, little as I esteem
myself, that I could put upon your services.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.839
Be so kind as to attend me today".

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.879
Do you think Elizabeth
could ever be persuaded to meet me here?

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.199
Even for half an hour? With Geoffrey Charles?

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.959
Would she do that behind Francis's back?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.599
No, she would never.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.279
But I do miss them so terribly.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.079
(Verity sighs)

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.759
You see. He will never be reconciled.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.319
(Door opens)

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.079
Dr Enys.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.879
How kind of you to call.
I haven't been waiting above three months.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.559
I apologise, Miss Penvenen.
I've been busy with my other patients.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.959
Doubtless they're more important than I.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.519
Only insofar as
their conditions are more serious.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.999
Well?

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.799
Are you going to examine my throat or not?

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.079
Open your mouth, please.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.879
Wider, please.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.919
Most satisfactory.
You'll have no further trouble.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.079
How brusque you are today.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.239
Is your friend Ross Poldark so peremptory?

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.479
He has little time for pleasantries,
ifthat's what you mean.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.639
Do you ride, Dr Enys?

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.479
For pleasure, that is?

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.519
I'm sure you'll appreciate I have very little time
when I'm taken up with...

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.919
More serious complaints.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.799
So, tell me, what are they?

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.719
Scrofula, phthisis, scurvy.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.959
- What can be done for them?
- For scrofula, nothing.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.359
For er...scurvy, a doctor's drugs are useless,

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.599
but simple foods - green vegetables, fresh fruit -
can effect an almost immediate cure.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.919
But...these are precisely what
the poor cannot afford, so they bleed and die.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.639
Why do they not spend less on gin
and more on oranges?

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.399
Oranges?

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.799
Oranges, when they can be had,
cost thruppence apiece.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.039
Gin costs less than sixpence a quart,
yet many are as sober as you or I.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.279
Will you do any good,
attempting to save these people?

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.319
They will only multiply
and then there'll be more mouths to feed.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.719
Of course, it's sad to see them die,
but at least it keeps the numbers in check.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.639
Do I shock you?

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.199
Only by your assumption that
you will not be included in this stocktaking.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.879
But of course I won't.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.279
I'm a Penvenen, so I'm rich and privileged.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.479
Would you excuse me, madam?
My patients require me.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.479
I shall take the liberty of returning your fee.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.399
You consider yourselftainted by it?

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.119
I bid you good day.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.399
(Indistinct chatter)

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.999
ROSS: Gentlemen, we have good news
to report. Mr Henshawe?

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.839
Our latest excavations
have taken us through to what we calculate

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.919
to be feet from the old Trevorgie copper lode.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.999
Now, I'm aware
this has taken longer than we'd hoped,

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.519
but it is my beliefthat
the next blast will see us break through.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.359
So it only remains for us to secure your approval
to divert this quarter's profits for the last time.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.559
One final push.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.839
Do we have everyone's agreement?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.559
- Eight weeks?
- Yes.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.879
Beyond your wildest estimate,
and you're still not through?

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.519
Ironstone is no respecter oftime or money.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.559
But we, as shareholders, must be, surely?

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.119
Each quarter, we've seen our profits
diverted into a scheme

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.599
which has so far yielded precisely nothing.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.439
Optimism's one thing,

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.479
but what ifyou've got your bearings wrong
and bypassed the old workings altogether?

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.439
No man in these parts knows the workings
better than Captain Henshawe.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:17.919
But if he's wrong,
you might dig on for years and never connect.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.479
HENSHAWE: I say we put it to a vote.

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.599
All those in favour of continuing?

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.719
All those against?

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.199
Motion to continue denied.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.159
Shall we close the meeting?

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.599
- There's nothing further to report.
- One moment, sir.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.799
You will no doubt have noted
the absence of Mr Renfrew?

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:50.119
As of yesterday, he is no longer a shareholder,
having sold his shares to me.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.999
GEORGE: Was he furious?

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.719
Not with me.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.279
But then he knows
I am not the actual owner ofthe shares.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.119
(Horse whinnies)

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.079
You pass my house without paying a call?

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.959
- How have I offended you?
- As I think you know, George, since the trial...

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.039
The trial? Is that not behind us now?

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.919
Cannot we move forward,
rekindle our former connection?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.359
- I'm not sure how possible that...
- Please.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.719
At least return with me
and take some refreshment.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.679
Mm.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.959
- Mr Trencrom.
- Cap'n Poldark.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.039
What can I do for you, Mr Trencrom?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.079
May a man not call, in neighbourly fashion,

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.039
enquire after your affairs,
see how they prosper, speak a little of his own?

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.159
Suppose you speak first of yours...

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.119
..so I may come to a quicker understanding
ofyour interest in mine?

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.999
(Trencrom chuckles)

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.679
I'm sad you've declined my invitations of late.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.719
We decline all invitations.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.759
We simply cannot afford to return the hospitality.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.799
May I venture to suggest
that I am a "special case"?

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:09.559
And, difficult as things are at Trenwith, they
could, I'm sure you realise, be so much worse.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.719
And if Francis cannot say so, allow me
to convey the thanks ofthe entire family.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.279
Not the entire family, surely?

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.839
MR TRENCROM:
My affairs do far from prosper.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.999
Oh, business is brisk,
as far as consumption goes.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.119
- The difficulty comes with the supply.
- So I hear.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.399
What do you hear?

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.999
That the customs officials at St Ann's
are determined to let nothing slip ashore.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.079
And that all your attempts to persuade them with
a share ofthe profits have fallen on deaf ears.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:52.559
And now this crackdown from on high means
that every time we find a new landing place,

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.599
we're met by gaugers and military.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.439
All cargo confiscated.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.159
Crew barely 'scaped with their lives.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.719
So here's the thing...
we've run out of navigable inlets.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.519
And I possess the only one for miles.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.999
Actually, I expect to be seeing
a good deal of Ross in future.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.919
- I've increased my shareholding in his mine.
- Oh.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.319
So I hope I won't have cause
to inflict undue pressure on him.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.119
Or on Francis, for that matter.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.719
What might cause you to?

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.799
I wonder.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:40.439
Your cove is not ideal,
but we could land there safely on still nights.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.039
I'd handle the distribution.
All you'd need to do is draw your curtains.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.479
And what do you think
would induce me to do so?

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.119
Ross...

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.879
We could discuss a lump sum per cargo.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.919
How does £50 sound?

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.559
(Chuckles)

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.679
I see you've not lost your sense of humour.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.799
(Laughs) Is that such a poor offer?

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.839
What would you suggest?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.559
£200 per cargo.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.039
- Ross...
- My dear sir.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.479
Impossible.
Make the journey almost without profit.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.759
- Not to mention salt.
- Salt?

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.959
There's less profit in salt than tea or brandy.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.479
Less call for it,
among my more genteel customers.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.519
£200 per cargo and six casks of salt.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.879
That's my price. Take it or leave it.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.879
(Trencrom exhales sharply)

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.959
What is it you seek, George?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.879
Your friendship.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.639
A renewal of our former intimacy.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.799
A gradual...increase in it.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.199
Is that too much too ask?

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.919
Particularly if it safeguards those you love?

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.399
(Trencrom chuckles)

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:29.159
I do not believe Francis would be happy
about my visiting here ofen...

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.879
..if at all.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.919
A pity.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.159
A very great pity.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.559
£200, for letting tub-carriers use our cove?

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.479
- That won't buy you out of prison.
- I don't intend to be there.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.319
I can't stand it again.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.559
The frettin', the not sleepin', the picturin' you
a-hangin' at Bargus Crossroads.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.199
Were we not in dire straits, I wouldn't do it.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.239
Today I learned that George
has bought up more ofWheal Leisure.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.759
With £200, we can keep our heads above water
and Sawle can salt its pilchards.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.479
Why is it fine for you to run risks when
I may not even take a boat out in calm waters?

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.439
Believe me, I have every intention
of keeping on the right side ofthe law.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.479
Or at least the blind side.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.239
'Tis a cryin' shame
we stopped the tunnel to Trevorgie.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.199
In my bones, I could feel we were close.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.199
- Where do you estimate we'd got to?
- Well...

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.559
..nigh-on that clump o' trees.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.959
- Halfway towards Wheal Grace?
- I'd say so. Your father's old mine.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.319
It's never occurred to me till now
how close it is to the old Trevorgie workings.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.359
Reckon 'twouldn't hurt to take a closer look
at Trevorgie from that end.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.239
Mebbe the old men found a way through
that we know nothin' of.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.399
Is that what Mark meant...

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.879
..the night he went away to France?

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.679
There's money in that mine.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.159
Copper.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.999
I never see'd a more keenly lode.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.199
- You think he wandered into Trevorgie?
- Could he?

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.359
- But if it's all under water...
- With no way of draining it.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.359
..we'd need one ofthem
new-fangled pumping-engines.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.519
Which cost.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.319
Let me think on it.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.599
If I decide to take it any further,
I'll come back to you.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.479
- What are you up to?
- Daydreaming.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.759
Wheal Grace?

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.199
You don't intend to resurrect her?

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.839
If my finances ever match my ambitions.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.479
(Chuckles)

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.239
The curse ofthe Poldarks.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.519
Plenty of one, none ofthe other.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.439
Dr Enys, are you now a peddler?

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.119
They're for my patients. When these are gone,
there'll be nothing till next harvest.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.919
- Do your patients enjoy worms and mould?
- Beggars cannot be choosers.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.799
(Indistinct shouting)

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.079
Almonds, sugar, oranges and chocolate.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.759
- You spoil me.
- May I not? (Chuckles)

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.959
But, in fact, it is not all for you.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.639
The sugar is for James,
the chocolates are for Esther.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.759
They come in a month. Are you happy now?

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.519
Yes, of course.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.319
Ah, Caroline.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.479
This from Unwin.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:15.159
Pressing the subject of an engagement.
Now he's an MP...

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.839
His coffers need to keep pace
with his ambitions?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.959
Oh, for shame, Caroline.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.559
One must not assume mercenary motives.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.239
I dearly hope that both of you
are marrying for love.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.039
(Laughs) You think Unwin loves me?

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.679
You do not?

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.959
I think he loves my £20,000.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.479
Oh, I will be sorry to think so.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.599
Does it not strike you as odd?

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.759
I'm an heiress, yet I have no money of my own.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.599
- Suppose you give me some?
- Well...

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.039
I-I have no objection
to advancing you something

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.399
but, in all the day, what will you spend it on?

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.839
I mean, your every need is catered for here.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.479
- £50?
- How much?

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.839
What's the use of being rich,
if one can't have a flutter now and then?

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.639
Caroline.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.359
You know I disapprove of gaming.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.279
But this would be a new type of gambling,
Uncle.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.159
It appeals to me
and I have a fancy to indulge the whim.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.559
I saw Ross.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.639
- Was he well?
- He's considering a new venture.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.639
Ofwhat nature?

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.599
Mining, of course. What else?

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.199
Whether we like it or not, it's in our blood.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.919
Right. Come on, boy.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.319
Shall we go see ifwe can strike lucky? (Grunts)

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.399
HENSHAWE: How far is it?
ZACKY: Quarter of a mile.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.519
HENSHAWE: Give me a shovel,
I'll dig it myself and be back in time for supper.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.519
- (Laughter)
PRUDIE: Someone's full ofthe joys of spring.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.599
Always is when he's up and doin'.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.959
'Tis sittin' still he can't abide.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.759
ROSS: This section's mostly shallow.
The lower levels are flooded.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.399
We'd surely need an engine.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.439
- Those two young engineers in Redruth...
- Trevithick and Bull?

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.919
- They've some interesting new ideas.
- At a price.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.079
And we don't yet know
ifthere's ore enough to make it worthwhile.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.679
Is it worth the risk?
We have these samples, this map, Mark's word.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.679
Your pigheadedness.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.359
- And against that?
- Ah.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.319
- Time? Money? Common sense?
- (Laughter)

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.599
Is it a secret or can we all be told?

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.439
All in good time.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:55.039
But, for tonight, draw the curtains early
and ignore any sounds outside.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.559
And where will you be?

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.559
- Taking delivery ofthe cargo.
- Ross, you cannot.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.919
- Already arranged.
- Dis-arrange it!

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.519
ROSS: Here they come.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.199
(Whispers) So far, so good.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.919
TED: (Softly) So I should hope.
Who else could know about this?

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.719
Yet the other landings
up the coast were surprised.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.719
- Mr Trencrom did advise us to trust no one.
CHARLIE: Keep the horse straight.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.719
(Whispers) Gaugers.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.519
PAUL: (Whispers) How many?

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.719
Just the one.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.039
Vercoe.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.719
- I'll head him off.
- Nay, Ross.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.959
If he sees you, you're as good as hanged.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.239
It's clear. Let's go.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.359
(Barks)

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.919
Ifthey varmints come troaching
across our flower-beds, I'll...

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.079
(Gate latch clicks)

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.239
(Door closes)

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.639
(Approaching footsteps)

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.519
(Door opens)

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.959
It's over.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.159
Is it?

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.119
Demelza, try to see this in a rational light.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.319
I'm home.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.479
The tide is high.
There's no footprints on the beach.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.799
There'll be salt for the pilchards.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.039
And we are £200 less in debt
than we were this morning.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.919
- Is it not a cause to celebrate?
- That you go against my wishes?

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.879
- For the good of us both.
- That you take risks you need not take?

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.559
- On this occasion...
- You think you can do as you please,

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.599
while I always do as you bid me?

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.359
Well, think again!

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.279
(Door slams)

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.399
Well, my love?
The Thunderer docks at noon.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.759
I'll collect James, then meet Esther off
the Plymouth coach and be with you by two.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.839
Do not make yourself uneasy.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.079
They will adore you as much as I do.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.599
Thank you so much.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.639
Miss Penvenen?

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.319
- Captain Poldark.
- Are you lost?

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.319
- Do I look it?
- You're far from home.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.599
Perhaps I enjoy my own company.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.159
You should make the most of it.
I hear you're to be married soon.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.239
Do you recommend the estate?

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.959
When both parties agree.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.999
We cannot all follow our hearts.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.159
Surely an heiress can?

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.959
What an amusing idea.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.719
Excuse me, I'm late for the hunt.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.559
Ross. Is it you I have to thank for this windfall?

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.599
What is it?

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.239
Oranges.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.439
I think we both know
I am not your mysterious benefactor.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.999
CAROLINE: Oranges?

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.919
Oranges.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.279
If I made you a gift, it would be a better
instrument for removing fish bones.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.199
You bruised my mouth with your fingers,
remember?

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.919
I knew it was you. I'm very grateful.
They'll be life-saving.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.319
Good heavens. You don't imagine I care
about the fate of a few fishwives, do you?

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.839
You wouldn't take my guinea.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.559
So...?

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.679
I knew your conscience wouldn't let you
refuse a gif for your starving patients.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.559
So you see, now you're under obligation to me.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.999
(Chuckles)

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.879
Is that where you prefer your men?

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.399
You're rather impertinent.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.599
I like you very much too.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.959
(Approaching footsteps)

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.159
Oh, there you are, Caroline.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.839
The fox escaped us but er...Dr Enys.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.839
Dr Enys,
I-I hear you're rather good at curing dogs.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.759
Did you notice Horace has
a little spot on his ear?

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.199
Has he?

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.159
Perhaps Dr Enys might take a look at it
after we've gone?

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.959
For 12 bags of oranges,
he shall have the best attention I can give him.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.839
(Indistinct chatter)

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.559
HENSHAWE: Do we wait for Mr Tankard?
- He knows the time ofthe meeting.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.679
Proceed, Mr Henshawe.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.319
Last month,
we sent two parcels of red copper to auction.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.559
This month we'll have two, maybe three.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.839
The question is, do we take on extra men,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.079
aside from those back on tribute
since the closing ofthe tunnels?

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:48.199
Mr Tankard is not here,
so we must take a vote without him.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.839
Gentlemen, sh...

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.919
Forgive my tardiness.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.959
The fox led us a merry dance,
but we got him in the end.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.359
Er... You were expecting Mr Tankard?

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.959
He will no longer attend.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:09.759
I feel, as a principal shareholder, it befits me
to take a more robust interest from now on.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:16.479
Perhaps you will kindly outline your suggestions
and I shall give them my best consideration.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.959
What do it mean?

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.559
It means we cannot move an inch
without his say-so.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.599
Nothin' to be done.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.399
Or is there?

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.159
You will sell half my shares in Wheal Leisure.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.359
If you wish.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:28.719
And you will demand the very highest price.
I know for certain George will pay.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.639
I think it's for the best.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.679
Indeed, had you done so a year ago...

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.919
Still, not too late to pay off your debts
and start afresh.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.519
Very true, but that's not in fact
how I intend to use the money.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.919
Ross, it's good to see you.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.359
Is Francis here?

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.399
- Yes, he's...
- Ah. I thought I heard your voice.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.679
- Is this a social call?
- Not exactly.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.319
What?

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.159
I'm opening Wheal Grace.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.439
- You don't mean it?
- Yes.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.999
That's cheerful news.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.599
Henshawe and I have been down.
The lower level's flooded, we need an engine,

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.319
but there's enough ore
in the shallows to get us through.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.639
- Who's investing the money?
- I've sold half my shares in Wheal Leisure.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.679
I can realise £600.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.599
- 600?
- Yes.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:44.759
Erm...you've told me more than once
about the money you've put by.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.359
Yes.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.159
With £1 ,200, we could do a great deal.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.919
- You're suggesting we go into partnership?
- Yes.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.799
ROSS: It's a risk, in more ways than one.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.679
- George has a long arm.
- To hell with George.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.959
- And you could well lose your money.
- Well, I like a gamble.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.079
One can gamble on a man as well as a mine.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.479
Well, I can't guarantee the mine.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.959
Well, ifthat's how you feel,
let's shake hands on it.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.999
Ross, before you take this forward,
there are certain things I should tell you.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.759
Past things?

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.759
And I shouldn't feel that I could...

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.599
- ..proceed unless you were fully apprised of...
- If it's the past, let's forget it.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.119
I don't think I want to hear it.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.479
Well, ifthat's the case,
I don't think I want to hear it myself.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:57.199
To the Poldarks.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.719
- Mr Ross won' like it.
- Mr Ross won't be told, will he?

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.079
No, mistress.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.759
(Knock on door)

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.039
I'm Esther.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.279
Oh. Oh, my dear. You've come too soon.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.839
No, I meant...
I did not expect you till this afternoon.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.519
I came on the early coach.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.159
- Is my father here?
- He's gone to meet your brother.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.879
Won't you come in?

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.039
Oh, my dear, it's...
it's so good to meet you at last.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.879
Will itjust be the two of you?

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.119
- No other shareholders?
- None whatsoever.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.359
There is one further point.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.719
I wish my shares in the mine
to be vested in my son's name.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.559
But he's still a child, isn't he?

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.519
Yes, but if George Warrlegan learns
of our partnership,

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.679
he may try to get at Ross through me.

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.359
But ifthe shares belong to Geoffrey Charles,

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.679
well, then George cannot touch them.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.519
As you wish.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.839
I've a fancy to buy a nosegay for Elizabeth.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.359
Shall we meet at the Red Lion
then ride home together?

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.319
By all means.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.519
(Dog barking)

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:05.119
You may be interested to know I've just
purchased more shares in Wheal Leisure.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.879
I wish you joy ofthem.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.719
So the rumours are true?

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.599
You and Francis
are going into business together?

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.439
I see you have your ear to the ground.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.999
Or should I say to the keyhole?

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.959
(Chuckles) I'm surprised to hear
you're pinning your hopes on Wheal Grace.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.919
What do you hope to find there? Gold?

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.679
No.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.239
Freedom to call our souls our own.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.079
I suppose you know where
Francis got the money he's investing?

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.519
Yes and we're very much obliged to you,
George.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.159
Yes, we paid it him for services rendered.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.399
In exchange for the names of
the Carnmore Copper Company shareholders.

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.159
£600.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.599
Or should I say 30 pieces of silver?

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.359
MAN: Hey! Hey, there!

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.919
Stop it!

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.959
(Grunting)

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.639
- (Clattering)
- (Man cries out)

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.439
Hey, there!

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.559
Get out!

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.959
Sir?

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.719
(Door slams)

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.999
Ross?

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.839
(Grunts)

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.999
(Panting)

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.039
DWIGHT: Could it be true?

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.039
Francis certainly had
the money from George.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.399
And it's clear to me
he had something on his conscience,

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.879
but the thought that he would
deliberately sell my secrets to George...

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.479
If it's true, how can I go into business with him?

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:42.759
- But if you accuse him and you're wrong?
- He'll never forgive me.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.439
So, either way, the partnership is doomed.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.399
ANDREW: Captain Poldark?
- Captain Blamey!

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.359
- You've been in the wars?
- My surgeon has patched me up.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.879
Dr Dwight Enys...Captain Andrew Blamey,
my cousin Verity's husband.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.799
- Your servant, sir.
- And yours, sir.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.639
If you're sure you'll survive,
I've other patients to attend to.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.439
Dwight!

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.239
There is one further service
you can render me.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.879
I don't think you're at all like your father,
are you, my dear?

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.279
No, ma'am. I favour my mother.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.159
She was very beautiful.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.799
More so than...

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.959
After she died, people tried
to poison me against her, but I know better.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.079
- She was a saint.
- Of course.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.599
And I know I could never replace her.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:55.919
But I hope you'll come to look upon me
as a loving friend.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:14.639
- Is Verity well?
- Exceedingly. Well, that's not entirely true.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.239
She tries to conceal it,
but I know she grieves the loss of her family

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.479
and I am the last person to intervene.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.599
- You are.
FRANCIS: Enys told me to come say hello.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.999
Apparently, you're barred from the Red Lion.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.519
- You...
- Walk with us, Francis.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.839
- You look as ifyou need the air.
- I will not trouble you in this company.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.839
Francis, this is the last moment
to wipe out the past.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:11.679
My erm...sister seems to find
her new life agreeable.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.399
And I will never give her cause
to think otherwise.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.599
- Not that she takes account of my approval.
- She would dearly love it.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.079
That's why I also desire it.

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:36.679
Suppose you've heard of my cousin's
encounter with George Warleggan?

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:40.879
Threw him across the Red Lion, broke his nose.

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.399
- Not quite.
- I congratulate you.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.599
I've wished to do the same myself.

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:53.119
Verity told me about a developing feud.
What was the cause ofthe quarrel today?

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.279
I took a dislike to his neck-cloth.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.639
(Andrew laughs)

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.039
Ow!

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.879
(Groans)

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.519
Time to go. Time to go home.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.679
(Groaning and panting)

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.199
Ow!

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.959
(Door opens)

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.839
Oh, Andrew, I can't bear it. Esther despises me.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.159
When James comes, pray excuse me.
I cannot face both ofthem together.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:37.199
My dear...this is James...my son.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.639
Good day to you, ma'am.
I've heard a deal of good about you.

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.359
You'll pardon the liberty, ma'am, but one
don't get a new mother every day ofthe week.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.879
Come down, Esther.

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:54.559
I know you'll be sulking, but this is
our family now, so it's well to get used to it.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.079
Do you have any rum, ma'am?
I've a powerful thirst on me.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.719
Of course.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:06.039
You spoke to him? Civilly?

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.639
And shook his hand.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.159
(Grunts)

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.119
(Gasps)

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.439
(Grunts and moans)

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:32.439
Demelza?

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.999
Garrick?

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:42.479
- Where's Garrick?
- Sir, I tell'd mistress not to go, but...

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.119
Prudie?

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.399
- You let her go?
- 'Ee ever tried to stop 'er?

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.319
(Mutters)

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.559
(Demelza grunts)

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.799
Give me the oars, Demelza.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.679
- I can manage. (Grunts)
- Give me the oars!

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:12.039
- You are the most stubborn, pigheaded...
- (Groans)

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.919
- Oh, I am?
- Where would you be if I hadn't come along?

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:20.479
Where would you be if I hadn't come along?
Drinkin' an brawlin' an' dodgin' the noose.

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.719
Let's examine my failings
at a more convenient time, shall we?

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:26.039
- (Grunts)
- Come on.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.319
Ah, Judas!

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.799
- (Grunts)
- Stop wriggling!

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.679
- You're hateful! (Groans)
- You're infuriating!

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.839
(Demelza screams)

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.479
- I could crown you!
- By all means.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.639
Once you've delivered our child.

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.479
(Footsteps)

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.999
You have a son.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.159
(Baby cries)

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.599
GEORGE: Miss Penvenen,
you're surely not returning to London?

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.639
- Help me to change her mind, George.
- Don't trouble yourself.

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:15.799
I must return to civilisation.
One can only take so many barbarians.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.519
Dr Enys?

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.919
I've ordered more oranges.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.359
Oranges?

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.999
Goodbye, Dwight.

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.719
Such a quaint name.

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.759
I wonder ifwe'll ever meet again.

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.959
Drive on!

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:59.919
Wheal Grace.
I never thought I'd see the day.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.559
Nor I.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.439
Nor any of us.

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.199
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.439
- To the Poldarks.
- And Wheal Grace.

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.759
ALL: The Poldarks and Wheal Grace!

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.599
ANDREW: Shall we go and have a look round?
ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.559
My father named this mine after my mother.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.199
He did love 'er.

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.239
He did.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.639
Yet folks said he was a wastrel.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.959
(Chuckles) While she lived, she kept him steady.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:42.479
- He set his course by her.
- Like the North Star.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.159
Like the North Star.

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:50.039
But I have no such need.

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:53.759
The North Star is not the brightest in the sky.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.359
Well, what is?

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.199
The Dog Star.

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.359
Which is fitting...

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.759
..since I found my star in a dog fight.
