We've had visitors, Cap'n.
From Wheal Radiant.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.359
Do we wish to sell our headgear?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.559
They didn't waste much time.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.639
- How much have they offered?
- A fair price.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.799
They're decent men.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.479
They know it could happen
to the best of us.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.519
The best of us would have bought timbers.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.399

Thank you, Prudie.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.119
Master Jeremy and I will be taking
our breakfast here from now on.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.279
Nay, but the chores is piling up downstairs.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.839
You're mistook, Prudie.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.559
This is a more genteel way of doing, I think.

Master Jeremy and I are gentlefolks, after all.

(Jeremy gurgles happily)

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.319
This is well met.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.799
I was just debating whether to write
and offer my commiserations.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.639
- On what?
- Your recent loss.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.479
Or should I say, losses?

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.839
And perhaps you've not heard...
Elizabeth and I are engaged.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.319
So, in the grand scheme ofthings,
you appear to be in disarray.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.359
And I appear to have won.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.079
As you say, George,
you appear to have won.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.039
(Horse whinnies)

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.679
- When do you expect him?
- Who?

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.799
My nephew is not always
the most subtle of men.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.919
Nor the most discreet.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.119
- I'm not sure I know what you mean.
- Oh, don't be coy, Elizabeth!

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.079
There's no one here but ourselves.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.559
You will know that I have never married.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.239
Perhaps you think that was an accident?

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.759
- Well, I...
- Perhaps I think so too sometimes.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.999
Then I remind myself I've yet to meet the man
who could better me.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.479
It is the better man we long for, is it not?

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.399
Sometimes it's not the most convenient man.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.879
But come, let us not pretend we prefer
a Warleggan under this roofto a Poldark!

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.639
Of course I'm sorry for his kitchen maid.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.759
But we have much to thank her for.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.199
But one must acknowledge the prior claim.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.959
So we can assume he will return to this house
as soon as he's put his own in order.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.879
Churn, I? I ain't churned since...

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.679
Since the maid first come. Showed 'ee what
a dog's gizzards 'ee ever made of it.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.479
Smirk all 'ee like. She'll give 'ee no aid now
with the calves or seeding.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.759
'T'ain't right.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.039
- Where's your mistress?
- Her bed.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.839
- Is she unwell?
- Must be.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.319
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.159
I can't decide.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.999
Hence the enquiry.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.279
It's been so long since the mistress let me bake,

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.279
I've mislaid all my skillage.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.719
It would appear so.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.919
Perhaps you could mislay this...
and bring me something edible.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.839
Oh, you're still here.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.799
Is Trenwith not yet in readiness?
Would you like for me to help you pack?

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.039
I thought you should know that
we're selling the headgear of Grace.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.519
The venturers ofWheal Radiant
have offered a fair price.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.039
Do you suppose that she ever seriously
meant to marry George?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.119
Surely it was just a trick
to get you to declare your hand?

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.759
I've no idea what she intended.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.639
Still, it worked, did it not?

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.679
She got what she wanted.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.439
Demelza, I never claimed to be perfect.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.599
Have I ever asked for that?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.879
Not as I recall,
but perhaps my memory serves me ill,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.519
for I seem to remember we promised
to forsake all others.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.799
I realise...that I betrayed your trust.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.959
Forfeit.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.359
And that your pride is wounded.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.119
Pride?

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.279
My pride?

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.839
To think I did always look up to you...

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.879
..respect you,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.599
revere you as my master
long before you were my husband.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.519
I see that, but...

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.679
For it did seem to me,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.399
unschooled as I was,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.519
that you were not like other men.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.879
You had a kind of nobility,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.159
not of birth, but of character.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.239
I was so proud to think
that such a man had married me.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.199
So now to discover that you are
so much less than other men,

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.039
or fallen so low because so far...

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.039
It is not my pride that is wounded, Ross.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.519
It is my pride in you.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.039
(Door shuts)

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.679
Sir John Trevaunance. Unwin Trevaunance.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.039
- Lady Whitworth.
- Her son Osbert?

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.879
The Honourable Maria Agar.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.199
- Sir Hugh Bodrugan.
- His brother Robert.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.159
William Hick. Mr and Mrs Alfred Barbery.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.039
Ray Penvenen. And his niece, Caroline.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.599
George Warleggan
to marry EliZabeth Poldark!

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.239
I could have sworn her interests
lay elsewhere.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.679
But plainly a lady may not always have
what her heart desires.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.759
(Chuckles)

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.599
- (Jeremy grunts)
- Jeremy!

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.799
Demelza.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.959
We cannot continue like this.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.319
If you could at least see it from my perspective.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.839
Soon you'll be asking me
to see it from Elizabeth's.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.199
- Hardly.
- Course, it's no mystery.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.079
Bet she can't wait to have you installed
in her house. Or in her bed.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.799
Demelza...

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.679
Indeed I do suspicion
that's exactly what her letter says.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.519
- What letter?
- It came about an hour since.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.399
She's doubtless wondering what's keeping you.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.559
Truly we wonder ourselves, don't we, Jeremy?

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.199
Wheee!

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.879
May I see it?

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.599
It's in the library.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.439
On your pillow.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.839
(Jeremy grizzles)

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.999
I may be out late tomorrow night.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.759
I'm going to Truro.
And I'm unsure as to when I'll be back.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.599
Why don't you just say it, Ross?
"I'm going to Elizabeth."

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.439
The letter was not from her.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.559
Of course not.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.519
Here. Read it if you wish.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.919
Richard Tonkin has been released
from debtors' prison and wishes to see me,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.639
no doubt to ask if I can assist him the way I did
Harry Blewitt when Carnmore collapsed, but...

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.959
..as you know, I have no money to spare.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.639
It's a pity. You'll miss the Bodrugan party.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.559
That's the least of my regrets.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.279
Demelza...

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.359
..I would never...deliberately hurt you.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.319
- You of all people must know that.
- Must I, Ross?

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.239
So I'm to assume that you inflict pain
by accident without a second thought?

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.959
In the moment, I admit it,
there was no thought of you.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.719
Or ofthe pain I might have caused.
It was as if I was possessed.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.719
Of course! No fault of yours.
Just a greater power,

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.999
- and you and her helpless to resist!
- In a way, yes.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.919
Perhaps I might have hoped for some...
understanding, knowing you as I do.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.879
Knowing me to be kind
and simple and giving?

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.199
Would you like me to throw myself
off Hendrawna cliff

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.119
so that you might bury me at your own
convenience and wed again at your leisure?

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.159
I don't blame you for your anger,
but how does it serve us now?

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.159
Serve us?

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.959
How did you serve us?

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.119
How does this...serve us?

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.599
Judas, what happened?
Pots all scattered to Jodes!

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.199
Clear this away.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.839
GEORGE: Lavish, ofcourse.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.679
No expense spared.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.919
After all, how often does a man get married?

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.279
From the lady herself?

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.519
No doubt anxious about some detail
oftrimming or confectionery.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.679
Will you excuse me?

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.759
ELIZABETH:
My dear George.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.319
I am writing to request the smallest offavours:

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.119
a postponement of our wedding.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.679
My dear. I cannot make head nor tail
ofyour letter.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.279
What can you mean by it?

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.319
George, I beg you.
Try to understand my position.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.559
These past few days,
it has dawned on me how rash I've been.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.599
Plunging into this marriage, such haste.
It does not look seemly.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.359
And you tell me this a week before the wedding
when all the guests are invited?

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.039
But did we not agree that this would be
an entirely private wedding?

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.599
A few of my closest friends
would be hurt to be excluded.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.039
George, I have promised to marry you

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.479
and look forward to beginning
our life together at Cardew.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.199
But I feel it would not be fair to either of us
to marry in haste.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.519
Is this anything to do with Ross?

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.039
Why would you think so?

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.559
Is it?

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.639
No. That is, obviously he does not favour
the arrangement.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.479
- Has he been here?
- He called.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.759
And he is behind this change of heart!
I knew it!

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.599
No! It is my own delicacy.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.279
Seeing him reminded me
how soon it is since Francis died.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.519
I beg you not to be angry with me.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.919
I...want to be indulgent...

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.039
..both before and after our wedding.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.159
It's a bitter disappointment to me.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.679
But I will try to agree to your wishes
ifyou will promise me one thing.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.359
- Yes?
- That you name another date today.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.719
Oh...

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.799
No... I cannot.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.319
Come, my dear, let us compromise,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.399
so that both of us may get something
from the arrangement.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.919
Grant me the consolation of being able
to fix a date - a month from today.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.719
- So soon?
- What is there to wait for?

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.079
What do you imagine will happen
in the meantime?

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.079
I do not know.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.679
Can I rely on you, Elizabeth?

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.719
Very well...

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.879
a month from today.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.159
- You would not!
- I would, EliZabeth. And so would you.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.599
DEMELZA: Give mybest to Elizabeth.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.319
Was it not clear? I'm not going to Trenwith.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.199
No, Ross. To Truro, that's right.
I remember.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.839
Servant come from Werry House.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.839
Sir Hugh begs to know
if you will attend the party.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.599
Oh, Judas, I forgot to reply to his invitation.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.879
Erm...tell the servant we sincerely regret that
Captain Poldark has been called away.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.119
Although...

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.919
..Mistress Demelza
would be delighted to attend.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.679
(Carriage approaches)

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.079
Finally.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.959
- Compose yourself, Elizabeth.
- (Clears throat)

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.319
What shall I say? How should I proceed?

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.359
With resolve, girl!

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.399
'Tis no easy thing you contemplate.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.759
'Tis for you to dictate the terms!

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.599
- You have more to lose.
- (Footsteps approaching)

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.399
Oh, my dear. I had to come.
When I heard you postponed the wedding,

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.079
I knew at once what was behind it.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.439
Oh, my goodness! Elizabeth!

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.799
Elizabeth! Oh, whatever's the matter?

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.679
Oh, Elizabeth!

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.919
Ross.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.959
I don't recall seeing that black eye.
Was it from the rock fall?

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.199
Must have been. Where are you headed?

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.199
I've been summoned to Trenwith,

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.799
I imagine to treat Mrs Chenoweth.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.519
How's Demelza bearing up?

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.279
After the disaster?

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.559
She was a godsend that day.
I know I'm preaching to the converted, but...

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.079
You've married a remarkable woman.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.599
Indeed.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.719
- And where are you bound?
- Truro.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.279
To Meet Richard Tonkin.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.079
Though I fear he wants to tap me for a loan.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.799
Shall we meet later? Take supper?

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.679
Or would you prefer to dine with Demelza?

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.719
Let's sup together.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.719
I know what 'ee be thinking.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.879
"What's good for the gander..."

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.519
I don't blame 'ee, maid,
but no good'll come of it.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.639
It's no cause for alarm.
Mrs Poldark has a fragile disposition.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.559
Doubtless she's been under some strain.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.599
Did she say she's postponed her wedding
to George Warleggan?

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.679
- Indefinitely?
- For a month.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.759
Give her these powders.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.199
- I'll call again tomorrow.
- Thank you.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.199
(Cries oftraders)

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.559
- Tonkin.
- Ha! Captain.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.359
- Good to see you at liberty, sir.
- I'll not forget your kindness.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.199
When hard times come,
many friends fall away. You did not.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.359
But your own affairs...

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.879
- Do not prosper.
- So I hear.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.519
You'll be wondering why I asked to see you.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.039
(Low chatter)

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.759
Ah! Mistress Demelza!

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:42.119
You ventured to trust yourselfto my care,
and lef your husband by the fireside!

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.839
Indeed I did, sir.
I decided it was not the weather for firesides.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.919
- Or husbands.
- (Laughs heartily)

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.119
Now, where have they put you for the night?

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.799
Ah, yes! The red room!

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.679
Two years ago, you advanced Harry Blewitt
the sum of£250.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.559
And believe me,
I regret I was unable to do the same for you.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.719
It saved him from debtors' prison.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.799
He was able to rearrange his finances
and start a small boatbuilding venture.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.279
He's had his fill of mining. I don't blame him.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.679
When I left prison, he invited me
to become his partner in the business.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.759
Our venture at present is small,
but we have high hopes.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.639
Of course, ifwe had more capital,
progress would be swifer...

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.399
I must stop you there.
If you're looking for investment,

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.959
you've come to the wrong man.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.959
(Laughs)

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.119
Investment? Dear me, no, sir.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.279
That isn't it at all.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.919
- It's good of you to invite me, Sir Hugh.
- I don't know why I do!

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.919
You've tripled your income in six months!

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.039
'Twas a moderate investment when we set out.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.039
But with the war...

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.799
..demand has gone sky high and now...

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.999
You've the makings of a first-rate business.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.279
And you too, sir. If you choose.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.559
(Jaunty folk tune on the fiddle)

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.559
(Laughter and chatter)

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.159
(Chatter dies down)

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.119
Mistress Demelza!

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.799
What a sight for sore eyes!

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.599
Perhaps you'll introduce me to your friends?

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.759
Oh, by all means.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.399
- Surely you jest?
- On the contrary.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.639
She was a scullery maid!

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.279
Then you should find her
all the more eager to serve.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.919
Oh, come, man,
I'm in sore need of entertainment.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.959
So you wish me to heap further ignominy
on Poldark?

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.239
By debauching his wife. Precisely.
Come, I'll introduce you.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.199
Mistress Demelza.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.759
Is Ross not here?

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.639
He's been called away on business.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.039
Where is Elizabeth?

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.719
- She has family matters to attend to.
- Hm, I can imagine.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.399
May I introduce Mr Tankard?

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.559
Your servant, ma'am.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.439
He's a little shy and barely knows a soul.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.159
- Perhaps you'll take pity on him.
- Oh, perhaps I will.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.919
- Do you dance, sir?
- I could be persuaded.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.519
Mistress Demelza,
know our friend Margaret Vosper?

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.119
Mistress Ross Poldark.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.599
Ma'am.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.279
I believe you two ladies
have something in common.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.919
- I believe we do.
- And what would that be?

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.239
Both devilish pretty women
who've only got to crook their finger,

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.079
the men come running!

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.039
I had no idea there were so many
handsome men in Cornwall!

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.519
It's fortunate for you that
you need not fear the competition.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.759
(Sir Hugh laughs)

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.479
I buried several husbands
and serviced countless more.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.119
I never see the point in beating about the bush.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.439
If you have a fancy for someone,
go up and ask them.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.079
Myself, I prefer to take time
making up my mind.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.879
Even if it do seem like beating about the bush.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.319
I'd sooner do that than get scratched
or worn on every bush I see.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.119
And does your husband share your delicacy?

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.119
- Shall we dance, sir?
- Mistress Poldark.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.319
Oh, Captain McNeil.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.439
What a happy coincidence.
May I escort you to supper?

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.239
Now you mention it,
I do have something of an appetite.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.879
And I'm a great believer
in indulging such a thing.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.599
Pray excuse me, sir.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.759
You may reclaim me presently.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.239
My dear, I would speak with you.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.599
Oh, I... I do not feel strong enough...

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.759
Elizabeth, don't be afraid.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.319
I understand your feelings.
They're quite natural,

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.479
after all that has happened.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.919
What...can you mean?

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.319
I sympathise more than you think.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.279
You wonder
how you can give your hand to George,

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.679
when your heart is committed elsewhere?

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.959
Yes.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.559
But...more than that...

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.839
There can be no more than that, my dear.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.639
You must let him go. He would want you to.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.479
- I do not think so.
- But I know that he would.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.319
And who can say better than I?

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.879
As his sister...
he is dearer to me than almost anyone.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.479
I know he and George
were enemies at the end,

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.039
but Francis would want you to be happy.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.879
And if George is your choice...

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.319
..I believe you would have his blessing.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.999
And yours?

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.919
And mine.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.399
Here.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.999
(Laughs)

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.199
(Demelza gasps)

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.319
(Both laughing)

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.239
(Cheering)

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.999
My dear life! I'm so hot, I could faint.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.159
- 'Tis fortunate you have someone to catch you.
- (Laughs)

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.959
And now...I have some sad news.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.959
Tomorrow I leave to rejoin my regiment.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.959
Oh, I think I shall weep.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.559
So, I wondered, as a special favour tonight...

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.239
would you consider...

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.799
..calling me Malcolm?

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.959
And, in return,
you'll be wishing to call me Demelza?

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.479
'Tis a very pretty name.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.519
What does it mean?

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.159
Well, my mother once told me that,
in the old Cornish tongue,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.279
it means "thy sweetness".

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.799
I would rather it meant "my sweetness".

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.279
It's very close in here.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.879
Shall we take a breath of air in the garden?

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.679
(Low conversation)

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.759
(Knock at door)

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.719
Well? Did he fleece you like a footpad?

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.039
No. He showered me with blessings.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.119
The debt repaid in full...

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.359
or a share in a profitable business.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.119
That's excellent. What will you do?

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.719
Iftruth be told, I'm half-tempted
to follow your lead and enlist.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.559
What, now, when things are looking up?

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.559
Surely, you've too much to keep you here?

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.119
Yes. You would think so.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.919
But...?

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.479
When are our choices ever straightforward?

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.639
Are you cold? May I fetch your wrap?

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.679
I have none.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.759
I'm glad of it.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.919
I know a better way to warm you.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.399
You're most attentive, Malcolm.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.199
Surely, you cannot be short of attention?

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.119
Everywhere I look, men are snarling over you.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.439
I fancy they do not suit you as well as...

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.879
As well as...?

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.119
Ever since I met you, I've wanted to do that.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.759
I hope you are not disappointed.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.479
On the contrary.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.159
You've given me an appetite for more.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.319
We should return to the party.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.999
Can you not give me a word
of encouragement before we go?

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.999
Surely, you've had enough already?

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.239
But will you not give me something to hope for?

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.919
Later tonight?

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.759
Which is your room?

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.719
I'm not well acquainted with this house, but...

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.399
..I think Sir Hugh called it the Red Room.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.439
I know it.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.799
Thank you, my sweetness.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.199
Thank you.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.759
- You seem distracted.
- Do I?

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.079
- Despite your good fortune.
- (Chuckles)

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.199
- Is all well at home?
- Yes.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.879
Well, no.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.639
Demelza and I... (Sighs)

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.279
Let us just say that attachments
are complicated, as you well know.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.519
Your cousin-in-law may agree.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.559
Elizabeth?

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.359
It was she I was called to attend at Trenwith.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:01.359
A fainting fit. She's postponed her wedding.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.239
She has?

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.039
Are you certain?

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:10.599
Clearly, the thought of marrying George
Warleggan was more than she could stand.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.159
Did anyone see you?

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.399
I hope I know how to conduct an ambush,
my darling.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.639
- So...you leave tomorrow?
- At noon.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.879
And I shall not see you again.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.839
You shall, if you wish.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.039
You may write to me, at Winchester.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.839
- Malcolm...
- My angel?

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.839
- Are you kind?
- Immensely.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.399
Then I beg you to bear with me, to understand

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.799
why I led you to believe that...

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.319
- It is on account of my husband.
- Don't think of him.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.079
- He has betrayed me with another.
- Is he insane?

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.599
- So I thought that I should do the same.
- Most assuredly.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.199
- Please, please, just hear me out.
- Have I told you how beautiful you are?

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.599
I begin to realise something about myself.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.359
Call it weakness, if you will,
but I cannot give myselfto any man...

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.879
- You can.
- ..except my husband.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.839
I am bound to him. I wish it were not the case...

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.799
My angel...

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.559
It does you credit to be so delicate.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.879
But think for a moment of me...

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.679
who's been looking forward
to this...encounter...

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.039
..as a mortal's taste of heaven.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:41.359
Your duty now is not to your husband...

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.479
..but to me.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.879
(Grunts) Malcolm, please...

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.879
(Gasps) Malcolm, stop.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.879
Stop! Malcolm!

00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.799
Stop!

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.959
I like a woman who knows her own mind.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.119
I thought you were such a one.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.039
My mistake.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.559
(Door opens and closes)

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.839
(Breathes raggedly)

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.199
Ross, I hate you.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.479
I hate you.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.119
Ross! What brings you here?

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.199
A disinclination to go home early.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.799
Well, join us, then, as we drown our sorrows,

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.999
eke out the last of our earnings.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.719
- Don't remind me.
- Oh, nay, Ross, don't take it hard.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.479
All of us were willing to work without timbers.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.199
And if it were to do again,
we'd none of us think twice.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.319
You cannot mean that,

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.159
after we lost Ted.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.159
Risky work's better than none.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:28.439
Grace put food on our table.
More than that. She gave us hope.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.799
I'll tell 'ee: were it not that the lode's buried
'neath 30 fathom of rock,

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.759
we'd be back down there like a shot.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.599
- You would?
- With Ted's blessing.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.679
- Damn, blast and set fire to it!
- What the blazes...?

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:02.159
SIR HUGH: I believe you're lost, sir.
Your room is on the east side.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.679
Thank you, sir. I know where my room is,
and to whom this one belongs.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.399
- But...no...
- Damn it, sir, she as good as invited me.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.559
Now, just scuttle off and turn a blind eye.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.479
Blind eye? I was going in there, myself.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.359
Don't tell me she invited you!

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.079
SIR HUGH: Blast it, sir. You had no invitation.
You thought you'd try your luck.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.319
TANKARD: Blast yourself, sir. I was here first.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.279
I'm the host. It's only right that I have first pick.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.999
A host should yield to a guest.
It is the proper etiquette.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.839
Etiquette be damned!
If you go in there, I go with you.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.519
I don't fancy we'll win her that way.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.679
Suppose we toss a coin?

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.119
No one shall say I'm not a sportsman.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.919
- Call.
- Heads.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.479
Tails. Stand aside, sir.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.919
What the devil...?

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.159
Well, I've never known a woman
promise so much

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.319
and deliver so little.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.199
(Sighs)

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.119
- Where's Demelza?
- Out.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.799
- Since when?
- Since she went to Bodrugan's party.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.399
Did she say she would stay the night?

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.639
- Did she?
- I don't recall.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.639
So, you've no idea where she is?

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.319
I reckon she's as much right
as any to stay out all night.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.919
Which she do.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.359
Demelza!

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.359
Ross. Kind of you to come and meet me.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.399
Did you have a pleasant time at Trenwith?

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.759
I told you:
I went to Truro to meet Richard Tonkin.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:21.559
Whatever you say, Ross. Do what you will.
Go and live with her, if you wish.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.159
It's quite possible
her marriage will still go ahead.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.519
No doubt you did your best to prevent it.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.919
No doubt I did.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.919
So, does she love George, then?

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.879
No, she does not.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:41.399
Demelza, I cannot blame you for your anger...

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.119
..but if you could bide a while,
have a little patience...

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:49.359
- Patience?
- ..this thing will play itself out, sooner or later.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.839
I see. So, you expect me
to sit and twiddle my thumbs

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.039
until you decide whether or not you want me?

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.159
It's not a question ofwanting you.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.479
It's a question of not wanting her.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.399
- Do you not want her?
- No.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.559
I don't know.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.999
- Sometimes...
- I'm not content to be second-best.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.999
- Have I asked you to be?
- Have you not made me so?

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.919
Why am I here, Demelza?

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.519
Why do you suppose I'm still here?

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.559
I don't know why you're still here, Ross.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.399
Because Elizabeth can't make up her mind?

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.799
No.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.519
Because Elizabeth does not want you?

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.599
Because she knows George is the better bet?

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.999
I came here with good news!

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.879
I came here to tell you
that Blewitt can repay the money I lent him.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.919
We can reopen Grace!

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.439
Demelza...

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.199
(Sighs)

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.839
You must take the decision alone.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.239
Aunt?

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.279
You cannot wait for him to help you.

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.599
I don't understand.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.599
How can he treat me so?

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.559
How can he leave things so...up in the air?

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.079
And not for the first time.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.759
Exactly.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.279
Once before, I waited for him
to come and see me, and when he did not...

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.559
You married Francis.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.919
- And now...?
- I do not know.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.959
He's deserted me.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.959
He tried to stop this marriage,

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.119
but offered nothing in return.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.879
He has taken what was not rightly his

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.159
and walked away from the consequences.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.879
Why did he have to come?

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.919
I hate him for it.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.639
He's left me with only one possible choice.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.759
(Church bells ringing)

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.959
I reckon it'll take two weeks to clear the rubble.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.999
And we'll have her up and running again.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.359
What are we waiting for?

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.399
I see Ross be not at his cousin's wedding.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.479
Such a pity
that relations with George are so strained

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.359
that Ross could not attend the wedding.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.519
If you say so.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.279
Come and sit with me, child.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.839
So, now you're all that remain
ofthe Trenwith Poldarks.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.679
No doubt Warleggan would dispense with us,
if he could.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.679
Oh, you'll hardly see him, Aunt.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.879
Once they're living at Cardew,
why would he even visit?

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.519
Elizabeth may come to see her mother,

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.559
but, to all intents and purposes,
you are mistress now.

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.639
You will visit me often?

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.759
Like old times.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.839
Ifwe close our eyes,
it will seem like 20 years ago...

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.199
..with Francis and Father still alive,

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.199
and Ross riding over every day.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.959
Ross?

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.399
Yes.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.159
How different might it all have been.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.679
He must wonder why I sleep here now.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:12.439
- Perhaps you should tell him.
- That you don't wish to have me near you?

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.679
Or that you now find me distasteful,
after the delicate charms of Elizabeth.

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.279
(Bell chiming)

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.919
ROSS: You'd never think
you almost lost your lives down there.

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.159
Well, we've all got to go sometime.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.399
I wish Ted could have lived to see the day.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.879
- You did all you could.
- It wasn't enough.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.719
I wonder ifthe Navy's so desperate
as to need a second-rate surgeon.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.679
The Navy will need all the men it can get,
ifthe war continues.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.759
An auspicious day.
Mistress Poldark should be here.

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.559
She's always taken an interest
in our ventures before.

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:05.719
Demelza has business elsewhere.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.839
- You were born for this life, my dear.
- I like to think so.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.319
London is full of beauties,
but you will outshine them all.

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.799
Such a privilege
to have Lord and Lady Warleggan to tea.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.319
Oh, have I ennobled you prematurely?

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:58.119
I'm sure the honour will soon be forthcoming.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.159
And how is Cornwall?
Do you see much of Dr Enys?

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.319
He attends my mother.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.679
So, he's finally moving in more exalted circles.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.559
I fear not, ma'am. I think
my mother is his only fee-paying patient.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.679
But how secretive you've been.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.359
You announced your wedding so late,
Uncle and I could not attend.

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.959
Erm...my wife kept me waiting a while,

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.279
until she gave her answer.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.759
Quite right.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.039
Marriage lasts a lifetime.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.079
A lady must be sure
she's making the right choice.

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.319
Hm.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.199
Ross! Ross!

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.039
Cap'n Henshawe be calling for 'ee.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.119
Can it wait?

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.879
There's something he needs 'ee to see.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.399
(Clatter of shovels in distance)

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.079
GEORGE: I've been thinking about
our domestic arrangements.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.639
You'll be glad to return home to Cardew.

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.279
I had thought so, but...

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:26.079
now I believe I've a fancy
to live somewhere else.

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.879
- I can scarce believe it.
- Nor I.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.839
When first I saw it,
I thought my eyes deceived me.

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.319
- What does it mean?
- It means...

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.599
I'm breaking the habit of a lifetime
and taking a drink.

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.279
- (Coughs)
- (Laughs)

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.719
(Laughs)

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.959
I've something to tell you.

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.879
We've reached the tin lode that was buried.

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.119
We've been working on it for some days,
and today the lode split.

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:23.159
One half is twice the size ofthe old lode.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:27.039
(Chuckles) Henshawe says
he's never seen richer ground.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.839
Demelza...

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.359
Do you understand what this means?

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.199
I'll be able to pay back the interest on the loan.

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.519
More than that.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:48.519
Soon...
we'll be in a position to repay in full.

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.679
I'm very glad for you, Ross.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.999
For us.

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.879
Do you not see how this changes things?

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:00.879
It will mean notjust survival,
not even a good living...

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.839
..but wealth.

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.359
After so long,

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.519
the very thing we hoped for.

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.199
And now it's here.

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.279
Has it come too late?

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.519
Demelza?
