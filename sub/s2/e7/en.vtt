00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.479
(Men calling out)

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.999
VERCOE: Will there be war, do you think?
- Inevitably.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.359
One does not send an anointed king
to the guillotine and expect no consequences.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.999
People are nervous.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.959
As well, they might be.
Jacobin clubs close.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.279
- Folk dig out old weaponry in readiness.
- For war?

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.439
Or for free trading?

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.679
Trencrom appears to be plotting his next run.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.679
Our informants have been lying low,
so, hopefully, we'll catch 'em off guard.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.439
(Sawing)

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.639
Garrick! Go to.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.479
- See 'em off!
- Nay, Mistress Poldark.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.159
- We come at the behest of Mr Trencrom.
- I know why 'ee come and who sent 'ee.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.999
Garrick! Garrick!

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.959
What do you think?
I reckon there's more tin in this than copper.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.599
Well, copper lodes do often peter out that way.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.959
What happens further down? Is there
more chance of copper at a greater depth?

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.559
Some would say our only chance.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.599
What do you say?

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.399
That she's been a grievous disappointment.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.439
Never a sign ofthe old Trevorgie lode, whether
we come at it from Leisure or from Grace.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.039
Yet Mark Daniel swore.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.279
Mark Daniel swore.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.679
(Sighs) If I were you,
I'd not throw good money after bad.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.399
Captain Henshawe reckons
we've enough coal to last two weeks.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.559
Three, ifwe close the lower levels.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.639
But our only hope is to go deeper.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.999
Then we go deeper.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.439
Mr Trencrom did send his regrets.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.119
Mr Trencrom can keep his regrets
and take his goods.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.679
'Twas never the agreement to leave them
three weeks afore they're fetched.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.799
It's taking advantage. I don't like folks taking
advantage and neither do Ross.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.759
Is it true? Your promissory note was paid?

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.479
It seems we both have a mysterious benefactor.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.519
Could it be the same?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.919
- Who knows?
- I'm glad of it.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.519
Though, in some ways, I regret the change.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.999
Now I've no further interest in Grace,
you no longer have a reason to call.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.359
I will always have reason to call.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.639
If you wish it.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.159
I wish it.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.839
(Puppeteer speaking as Mr Punch)

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.759
(Laughter)

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.199
Those properties we spoke of,
have they been acquired?

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.399
The deal will shortly be concluded.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.439
Unwin has his uses.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.999
When will you demolish them?

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.839
- All in good time. First, we increase the rents.
- The tenants will object.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.359
Then we evict them. Then we demolish.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.399
Then we build.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.559
The Warleggan bank!

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.599
- Morning.
- Morning, Dwight.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.399
- Good day to you, Jacka.
- Is it?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.999
Surgeon! Welcome.
You couldn't have come on a better day.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.119
- You're in high spirits, sir.
- Well, so would 'ee be, were 'ee in my shoes.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.439
Rosina has agreed to wed me.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.319
I hope you'll both be very happy.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.479
Now, er...how are you, Betty?

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.279
Will you open your mouth
so I can look at your throat?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.639
- Aye, sir, we have you to thank.
- So we have.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.519
Rosina's lipsy leg cured.
Me and my consumptives.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.479
And now earning fair from sail making.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.919
So I see.
It certainly seems to afford you a good living.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.119
Hard work do that, Surgeon,
as you did ought to know.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.679
And when is the wedding to be?

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.119
Well, the banns are called this Sunday.
Nothing to wait for now, is there?

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.999
Your turn next, Surgeon.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.039
- We shan't trouble 'ee again.
- Till the next drop.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.879
Be sure to make no commotion as you leave
and bring the gaugers down upon us.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.919
(Clattering, Garrick barks)

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.879
Oh, my ivers! 'Tis they, the gaugers.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.039
Go. Go!

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.519
So do 'ee bring his fizzog home sometimes?

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.479
I be about Trencrom's business!
I be his man now!

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.759
- I'll give you such a lib sin...
- Hush your clack, woman!

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.519
I didn't come home to argeefy!

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.759
No, no!

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.279
Leave him be. Jud!

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.719
- (Garrick barks)
- Enough!

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.279
- Aah!
- Two stomachs to eat and neither one to work!

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.359
The noble art of Cornish wrestling.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.279
- You have a message for me?
- Aye.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.399
Ohh.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.839
Mark Daniel has been found.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.559
- Where?
- Cherbourg, he was.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.159
Then, with all this kick and sprawl, folk did look
at him askance, so he slips offto the Scillies.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.559
- Can a message be got to him?
- 'Tis done already.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.279
Mr Trencrom's ship, The One & All,
sets sail for France tomorrow on a run.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.479
Look in to St Mary's on his way to France. Mark
will meet 'ee there. He'll return the same way.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.519
I don't like it, Ross.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.879
You'd be joining a smuggling run.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.159
There's no other way. I must meet him.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.399
- I'll tell Mr Trencrom.
- Aye, and when that's done,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.279
drag his sneivy carcass back here.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.039
- No, 'tis too risky.
- Nay, but...

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.639
There is an informer about.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.839
The last few runs we've had no trouble,
so Trencrom do reckon he's gone elsewhere.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.359
Anyways, tid'n I?

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.719
- Pick my liver, do 'ee think I be such a man?
- No, of course not.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.639
Informers be sharp and witsy.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.079
Exactly.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.599
(Door opens)

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.519
I see I have a rival.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.399
"From Rosina, with love."

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.559
Is that how all your patients address you?

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.799
Orjust those in receipt of miracles?

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.959
Uncle Ray bids me to travel to London
with him on the third.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.759
So we must escape on the second.
It will make my packing all the easier.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.999
Instead of escaping with a bundle
through the window,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.679
I can have my trunks downstairs
and safely stowed in the coach.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.479
What is it? Do you not want to marry me?

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.039
Oh, Caroline.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.239
Marrying you, openly,
would set a seal on my happiness

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.199
which I don't deserve, but would gladly take.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.239
Marrying you in secret,
running away with you at night...

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.479
Yes?

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.679
..it smacks of dishonesty, ofthe fortune hunter.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.719
Which we both know you are not.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.559
Why can we not go to your uncle
and tell him what we intend?

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.919
Have I not explained? Ifwe run away in secret,
Uncle Ray will be furious, but...

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.559
And rightly so. He'll denounce us
in the strongest possible terms.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.599
But only to himself.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.559
In a year, he will calm down and then there will
be nothing to prevent a reconciliation.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.199
He will accept what cannot be changed.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.519
Exactly.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.399
But a direct confrontation, "I will marry this man,
with or without your blessing",

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.279
I will be going expressly against his wishes.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.319
He and I will argue, his pride will prevent him
from backing down and...

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.479
I will never see him again.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.079
I acknowledge the rationale,
but dislike the subterfuge.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.119
Because you are too honourable.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.799
Because my honour has been
compromised before. You know this.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.239
The girl I fell in love with, Keren Daniel,
she, too, was a patient of mine

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.159
and though her death was not at my hands,
it is on my conscience.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.479
- That I understand, but...
- Also on my conscience

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.079
is the fact that you are giving up
your fortune for me.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.919
In the first place, I am not.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.599
I am just deferring it.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:11.559
And, in the second, even if I were,
it would be worth it, to be your wife.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.399
- Do you doubt me?
- Not your intent.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.879
But you may find the reality
less romantic than you imagine.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.759
(Jud and Prudie arguing and yelling)

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.879
Conjugal bliss.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.039
A rare commodity.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.439
Yes.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.319
(Distant arguing)

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.399
(Birdsong)

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.719
AUNT AGATHA: Are those plaguy
scavengers here again?

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.039
ELIZABETH: The Reverend and his family?
Yes.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.799
In our house.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.439
Once a week, Aunt. You know of our obligation.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.279
Along with repairs to the church.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.319
Walls. Bridges.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.359
Alms for the poor.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.279
A fine trick to bleed dry
the foremost family ofthe district.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.199
The once foremost family.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.599
A pity their appetites show no such decline.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.959
Where's Ross?

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.239
Why does he not visit so often?

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.239
Ross has his own affairs to attend to.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.999
We can manage without him.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.719
How long will you be gone?

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.359
Two days.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.519
Depends on the weather.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.479
The One & All will load goods in France
and return to collect me.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.359
I'll be taking Henshawe and Paul.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.119
Mark will be glad to see his brother. Henshawe
knows Grace like the back of his hand.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.839
He'll have questions for Mark
which might not occur to me.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.719
Is this really our last chance?

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.679
We have two weeks of coal left.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.239
After that, the pumping engine stops.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.839
And so does Grace.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.439
Don't 'ee fret, maid.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.479
Old Jud will be on the case.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.639
Well, that'd make all the difference.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.359
Why did we not look for Mark sooner?

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.399
All this time, we could have had clear direction
instead of guesswork.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.079
And Grace could be in profit.
Maybe your luck's turning.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.759
First your mystery benefactor.
Now the finding of Mark.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.599
A change in our fortunes?

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.759
I could certainly drink to that.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.599
Two angels in the sky.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.759
That's a pretty picture, Hubert.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.199
- Did you colour it yourself?
- Yes.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.639
Give him ginger, oil of anise and clarified honey.
That should settle his stomach.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.279
- Thank you.
- And you, sir?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.319
Are you in good health?

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.479
Aye, sir, weary to the bone.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.399
Up all hours ofthe day and night
in pursuit ofthe free traders.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.839
- You take your duty to heart.
- If I don't, who will?

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.679
'Tis a thankless task,
but I expect my patience to be rewarded.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.439
And I reckon it is coming.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.599
You can be sure ofthat.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.119
(Men shouting)

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.759
(Low conversation)

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.559
(Man calls out)

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.279
- You will ride to Trenwith.
- To what purpose?

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.119
To alert the family to the latest events in France,

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.159
the execution ofthe King,
the expected response from London.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.719
Warn Mistress Poldark of potential unrest.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.679
Advise her to make secure
her windows and doors.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.719
But will this not frighten her?

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.359
It may well.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.879
Tell Mr Warleggan
I'm grateful for his concern, but...

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.079
Had he no other suggestions to make?
No assistance to offer?

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.399
I think he felt it would be impertinent to interfere
with your domestic arrangements, ma'am.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.039
Of course.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.599
That's most thoughtful of him.
Please convey my thanks.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.039
I'll ask Tabb to secure all the locks and bolts.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.279
Or, better still, fetch me a pistol.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.799
- I could stop an intruder in his tracks.
- I don't doubt it, Aunt.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.959
With or without a firearm.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.599
To Ross?

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.479
I thought I might ask him to call and advise us.
I know you'd welcome that.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.119
Of course.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.239
'Tis only my comfort that concerns him here.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.479
Hmph.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.119
Mr Ross ain't here, but he'll see it on his return.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.159
God bless 'ee, child!

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.999
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.679
(Giggles)

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.639
- (Knocks)
- Oh, what now?

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.199
Is your master at home?

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.639
Er...

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.439
(Door opens)

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.839
Oh, Dwight.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.759
I...I didn't mean to disturb you.
I called because Ross is usually home now.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.199
He's away a few days. Is it urgent?

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.959
Er, not in the ordinary sense.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.319
Why don't you ask Jinny to make us some tea?

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.839
I know that Ross won't mind me
telling you this, but...

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.599
..he's gone with Trencrom's ship,

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.759
dropping off at the Scilly Isles
to meet Mark Daniel.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.999
Then The One & All will pick up Ross
and bring him home,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.839
when they anchor off our cove for the drop.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.199
It seems a lifetime since that night,
when you stood between me and Mark.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.959
- He would have killed you.
- I'd have welcomed it.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.999
I'd betrayed everyone
and everything I held most dear,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.479
but that's the last thing
I want to remember tonight, I...

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.439
I came to tell you I'm leaving.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.999
To be with Caroline?

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.799
How did you guess?

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.959
(Scoffs) And you're to marry?

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.599
- Oh, Dwight!
- But her uncle forbids it.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.279
So we must do it in secret.
We leave on Friday night.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.559
- Well, cannot you stay here?
- Not within her uncle's reach.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.479
And, besides, I owe it to Caroline to start afresh

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.839
in a new town,
where my history with Keren is unknown.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.879
Well, I'm...I'm happy for your sake,
but... for ours...

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.599
You'll be sorely missed.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.679
I want you to know and to tell Ross...

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.239
..how much I owe to you both.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.879
Leaving like this, it's...

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.079
..it's...it's a great sorrow to me.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.239
Marrying for love is not a time for grieving.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.679
Worry about us and our ailments till Friday,

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.399
but...then build your new life
as ifwe'd never been.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.839
Mark said he'd meet us at the Quayside Inn.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.919
PAUL: 50 men?

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.439
I'd hope to employ twice that
before next year is out.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.999
If I could see
all Grambler and Sawle employed...

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.519
- 'Twould be a fine thing.
- 'Twould indeed.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.559
Well, here's to that.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.079
And to Mark.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.039
- In him we trust.
HENSHAWE: To Mark.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.119
Miss Penvenen.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.639
I was passing and it struck me as remiss
I have never paid a call.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.919
And soon you'll be leaving for Bath.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.439
Oh.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.279
Did Dwight say so?

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.799
And here I am thinking
that he might have changed his mind.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.559
Why would he?

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.319
You know men.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.959
So changeable.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.599
Do you not find?

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.679
I think Dr Enys is as like as any
to remain steadfast.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.079
Is that your experience of husbands?

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.479
I mean, generally, to be relied upon?

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.919
- Some tea?
- Why not?

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.399
(Rings bell)

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.719
And how fares Captain Poldark's
mining venture? Is that also secure?

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.759
Far from it.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.519
Oh, dear.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.679
Well, I suppose one can't have everything.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.839
I suppose one cannot.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.679
Did Ross reply?

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.319
He did not.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.079
It's unlike him to be so remiss.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.199
I wonder what could have detained him.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.799

a burning, shining light

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.679

Brother! Oh, 'tis good to see 'ee.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.719
How are you?

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.879
CAROLINE: DearDwight,
I'm afraid there's been a complication.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.039
W have to meet tomorrow morning.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.119
I never touch it now.
I keep a guard on my tongue, night and day.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.439
You know why we wished to meet?

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.479
Like you said in your letter,
about what I saw down Grace that night.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.959
Ever since I've been trying to think.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.999
- 'Ee don't remember, brother?
- Oh, I mind what I saw.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.639
But where I see'd it?

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.519
I was fair crazed that night.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.279
- Would a plan ofthe workings help?
- Oh, it would. It would, indeed.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.479
Well...

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.999
Wait.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.039
I went down here.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.679
Go on.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.839
I... I think there was water.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.919
And then I walked in the 30 level.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.479
I sat down and thought to end it all by drowning.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.119
Then I got up and I went bearing east.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.279
Across a plank, half rotten.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.039
You gave her a headstone, like I asked?

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.199
We gave her a headstone.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.959
"Keren Daniel, wife of Mark, aged 22."

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.999
Like you asked.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.839
22.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.999
Still a child.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.999
That surgeon, Enys,
it was 'ee I should have killed.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.039
Try to remember, Mark.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.119
Where did you go next?

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.239
Just above the gunnies, bearing right,
there's an old pick down there.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.479
I took it up and began to cast around.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.279
A fine bit of ground it looked.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.519
Where was it? Just...here?

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.079
I reckon.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.919
I went on again, climbing all the while.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.919
- There was an old air shaft.
- Here?

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.119
It was all filled in.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.719
I reckon I was barely 15 fathom from grass.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.799
And from there, you can turn three ways.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.439
I turned east.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.159
And you go down over broken ground
where the lode has been worked,

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.199
but...only the bottom.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.759
The backs is untouched.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.359
There be fine quartzy rock and gossan.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:21.319
It was too high for me to get at, but I'd wager
there'd be a mint of money in that place alone.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.479
Just...here?

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.519
Just here.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.159
And, after that, you came up?

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.319
And after that I came up.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.439
Thank you, Mark.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.999
Thank 'ee.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.839
(Hissing)

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.919
(Thud of machinery)

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.639
'Twas when he mentioned quartz
and I looked at ye.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.479
'Twas the first thing we found.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.959
- And it barely paid for the working.
- Mm.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.599
- I blame myself.
- Nay, Cap'n Ross.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.719
To pin everything on the ramblings of a man
crazed with grief and rage, what was I thinking?

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.559
It could have been true.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:16.879
At the outset, perhaps, but experienced miners
cannot work for months on end

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.319
and not find whatever good ground is there.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.359
It's the old story.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.519
The drowning man and the straw.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.199
- I only wish...
- Yes?

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:50.079
That there was some other way,
which did not require us to leave so furtively.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.479
Or leave at all.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.559
What do you mean?

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.479
Are you sure you don't regret
more than the manner of our leaving?

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.799
Ever since we decided to go,
I've noticed a reluctance in you.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.439
Not at all. I love you.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.599
What reluctance could I have?

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.079
Yet I wonder.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.719
Six months from now,

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.479
will you not sometimes sigh for your Cornish life
and your Cornish Rosinas?

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.399
I may well. They matter to me.
I cannot pretend to be indifferent to their fate.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.799
But my mind is set.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.399
So, tonight, then?

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.799
Tonight.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.559
(Knocks)

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.839
Inquire of Mistress Poldark if her safety
measures are in place. Urge her to be vigilant.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.559
Word has reached me of some tinners

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.239
who propose to claim their right
under Stannary Law to enter private land.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.439
Warn her to be on her guard.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.359
Prospect for tin?

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.919
On our land?

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.719
These people are a law
unto themselves, ma'am,

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.999
and Mr Warleggan fears
they may be encouraged to rise up

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.919
by the example oftheir French counterparts.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.519
Once again,
I thank Mr Warleggan for his concern.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.439
If Mr Warleggan is so concerned,
why does he not come here himself?

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.999
The male ofthe species, inadequate, at best.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.359
Better to rely on one's own resources.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.719
I'm away to Sawle to see ifthere's any news.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.399
Keep Jeremy from his nap.
I want him sound asleep all through it.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.919
May I speak with Ross?

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.559
He's from home.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.839
Did he not receive my note?

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.319
Prudie?

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.759
- Do 'ee know of any note?
- Yes, Mistress.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.519
I do give it to Mr Ross myself,
into his very own hand.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.959
Oh.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.079
Then I expect he was too busy to reply.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.359
Yes. I expect he was.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.639
Here you go. I've got potatoes...

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.199
Mistress Demelza!

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.119
Ohh!

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.159
Rosina!

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.479
Is it your knee?

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.439
'Tis like it belonged to before Dr Enys mend it.
Only now it is worse.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.999
- We should send for him.
- I'll set Charlie to it.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.719
Nay, he be sick. Remember?

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.759
Dr Enys bid him to keep to his bed.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.719
I'll go. You keep her warm and still.
I'll be back directly.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.639
(Knock at door)

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.559
Demelza, what brings you here?

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.959
Rosina Hoblyn, 'tis her knee locked again.
Can 'ee tend on her?

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.439
I...I fear I cannot.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.399
My plans have changed.
I'm due to leave with Caroline.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.279
Tonight? But...I... I thought...

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.439
It was tomorrow, yes, but her uncle...

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.839
No, no, you must go. I'll see to Rosina.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.879
Maybe call Dr Choake.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.759
Yes. That would...

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.879
No. Wait. Er... I cannot allow that.
She's my patient.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.799
Caroline's expecting you.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.479
I think, if I leave now, there'll be time.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.999
For the first time in my life, I feel old.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.479
We're none of us as young as we were, Ross.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.639
These last few years...

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.999
Often I've known failure, but...

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.959
..I always believed it was a temporary setback,
but this time...

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.199
- 'Twas a brave venture.
- Was it?

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.839
I begin to think it was the height of my folly.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.839
To throw away a profitable investment

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.039
and pour everything I had,
and persuade Francis to do likewise,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.599
into a played-out mine that failed my father
a quarter of a century back?

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.919
I didn'tjust gamble with money. I gambled
with the happiness and security of my workers

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.639
and, most especially, that of my wife and child.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.479
What'll 'ee do now?

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.999
(Sighs) Learn my lesson.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.199
Plough my fields, harvest my crops,
cherish my family.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.279
Live a quiet life.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.479
There's a lot to be said for it.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.639
My wife would agree with you.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.359
Tell me what happened.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.399
I turned it on the cobbles, sir,
and it sudden go all tight.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.359
We thought to send Charlie for 'ee, but since
he be sick, Mistress Poldark did kindly go.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.039
- What's the matter with Charlie?
- You did ought to know that.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.919
'Tis on account of 'ee telling him to stay abed
that he's not helping with the run tonight.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.879
Aargh! Aargh!

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.199
There now.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.479
- What did 'ee do?
- Can you stand?

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.439
(Giggles) 'Tis all mended?

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.039
Oh, sir, I'm that grateful.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.079
- 'Twas afeared 'twas gone for good.
- I think you should wear a bandage.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.519
At least until the tendons knit together
and if it ever happens again...

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.959
Why, sir, if it do, we'll just make her sit quiet
till we call for 'ee again.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.319
- You'll take a dram?
- No, I...

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.279
Thank you. That's most kind.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.479
- (Jacka pours drink)
- What's this about Charlie?

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.399
- Did he tell you I said he must go to bed?
- Not I, but them as wanted his help with the run.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.919
I don't understand.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.639
Trencrom's ship is coming in tonight.
They sent round to tell him to be ready.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.959
But he said he's a fever and the surgeon said
he must stay abed, on account of his lungs.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.199
I said no such thing.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.879
Why would he tell such a strammin' great tale?

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.199
Your wedding's in a fortnight?

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.439
Aye.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.159
He'd be anxious about the risk and about
his health. It's a thing any man would do.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.079
- I must leave you now.
- Till 'ee come again.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.919
It's been my privilege to be able to help you all.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.919
The informer...

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.479
..could it be Charlie?

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.559
- You must keep to your plans.
- No.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.959
- I can go to Charlie and still get to Killewarren.
- What will you do?

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.079
Confirm our suspicions. We may be mistaken.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.119
But the drop's tonight.
What ifthere's an ambush?

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.079
- I'll come with you.
- No. You must not.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.079
If you're seen out and about
and the ambush is set...

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.239
Go home. I'll to Charlie.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.319
Then ride like the wind to Caroline.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.799
(Sighs)

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.279
Was that a yawn, Horace?

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.439
I know, my pet.
We have a long journey tomorrow.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.319
And Uncle Ray is looking weary.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.399
Assure...Horace...

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.279
..that Uncle Ray, though undoubtedly ancient,

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.599
still has enough stamina
to complete his correspondence.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.399
Is it important?

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.839
Instructions to my steward, regarding the estate
while we're...while we're away.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.879
How odious I should find that.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.199
Well, all the more reason
to marry wisely, my dear.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:41.999
When you come to inherit, you'll be grateful
for a husband who takes such matters in hand.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.119
Lottie, I've come to visit your father.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.279
- It's good of 'ee to call, sir.
- Sit up. I want to examine you.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.959
- Nay.
- Sit up, man.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.639
You say you have a fever?
Let me see what ails you.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.199
DEMELZA: Good evening to you, sir.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.399
'Tis a fine night.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.439
Aye.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.839
Well, if you will not retire, then I must.
My eyes will not stay open.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.599
Right, I won't be long.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.319
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.399
- You have no fever.
- Nay, sir.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.279
Three hours gone, I was all of a shrim...

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.039
Why the sham? An excuse to avoid your part
in the tub-carrying?

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.319
I swear, first it come on me like ice.
Next, I was sweating like a weed.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.359
For two years, there's been an informer about.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.399
Well, everyone know that.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.239
Have 'ee caught him?

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.399
I rather think I have.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.279
Stay alert, men. They could be anywhere.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.559
Well, that's a fine thing to say!

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.679
How do you afford these curtains?

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.319
Those candlesticks?

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.919
Out of sail-making?

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.959
Or selling your friends?

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.959
Get out. Now!
And take your nasty suspicions with 'ee!

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.559
It's you who should get out, before your friends
realise you've betrayed them.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.599
Thee's the betrayer. Making eyes at Rosina,

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.719
fingering her knee
when 'ee think no-one's looking?

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.239
- What time is the run?
- I don't know.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.279
Is there an ambush?

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.319
- I don't know.
- I think you do know.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.959
Think what 'ee like. You've no proof I'm a traitor.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.519
I beg to differ.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.959
- Where did you get this book?
- I buyed it.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.599
- Where?
- Redruth.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.719
This book belonged to Hubert Vercoe,
the Customs Officer's son.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.039
- I saw it in his hands.
- That proves naught!

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.399
- There are many such books.
- None like this.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.919
With the angels' wings coloured red
by Hubert himself.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.159
- There was a soldier.
- Save us!

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.919
- Where?
- By the long field.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.199
And Ross will walk straight into the ambush.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.599
- What will 'ee do?
- You'll know when I've done it.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.719
You go home, Surgeon.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.759
Forget what 'ee see'd.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.119
There's nothing you can do now.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.839
Pssst!

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.919
Stay low. Stay low.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.519
Keep the candles burning
and don't let anyone enter.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.279
Why, maid, what do 'ee intend?

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.999
I'm gonna try and get down to the cove
and warn 'em before the ship comes ashore.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.079
(The One & All creaks)

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.639
There's the sign, Hensh, that's us.
Start loading up.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.319
I must ask you to remain indoors this evening.
Trooper Wilkins will guard you.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.839
Against what, may I ask?
Do you suppose there to be an enemy about?

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.879
Of sorts, ma'am. We have word that the
smugglers intend to use your cove tonight.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.639
Where's your husband?

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.119
He's in St Ives. He'll be back tomorrow.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.559
- Would you like a glass ofwine?
- Thank ye, no. I'm on duty.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.719
What is it that you want with my husband?

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.519
What have we to do with this?

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:07.599
Nothing, I hope, but since it's your land,
I think ye can hardly be as innocent as ye look.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.519
Why would you do it? Betray your own folk?

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.159
What folk? Nobody did aught for me.
Folks only look to theirselves in this life.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.359
- By selling their friends?
- I done what I done.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.519
You don't have to like it
and 'ee don't be myjudge!

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.279
(Chair legs clatter)

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:33.039
My dearest uncle, for most of my life,
you have been both father and motherto me...

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.999
(Poker clatters)

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:50.159
Believe me, ma'am, for the favour
of your goodwill, I would pay a very high price.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.319
But none which involves a neglect of duty.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.919
And what should I do?

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.319
Make no attempt to leave.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.319
I can ill spare Wilkins,
but you give me no choice.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.919
(Blade scrapes table)

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.599
Urrgh!

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.199
Charlie...

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.439
(Groans)

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:05.359
You mustn't risk coming ashore with us, Hensh.
Stay aboard till she docks at St Ann's.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.519
- Gladly. Good luck.
- Stay safe.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.159
(Owl hoots)

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.999
Take a seat, ma'am. 'Twill be a long night
and you'll not wish to tire yourself.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.879
I'm sure I don't wish to be given orders
in my own house.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.839
Wish it or no, 'tis my orders we go by,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.959
so you'll kindly oblige me
by keeping where I can see you.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.479
DEMELZA: And what ifwe wish
to get some sleep?

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.079
I must ask you to do so here, ma'am,
so I can keep an eye on you.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.879
Cap'n.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.599
(Waves splash against the oars)

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.279
(Grunts)

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.559
VERCOE: Wait till everything is offthe boat.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.719
Flemmo, take this.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.639
- Up there.
PAUL: Ted!

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.039
Did you find your brother?

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.439
- We did.
- Was he well?

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.759
- Did he have aught to tell?
- To tell? Yes.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.559
Of any use? No.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.639
Ross, what's that?

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.599
Ambush.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.239
Relaunch.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.879
- Relaunch!
- Come on!

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.479
(Panicked shouting)

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.559
- Relaunch!
- Come on!

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.959
- Relaunch!
- Come on, boys!

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.159
Go! Go! Go!

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.919
- (Men shouting)
- Go!

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.119
- Come on!
ROSS: Get in!

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.199
Push!

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.479
Go!

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.119
ROSS: Get in!
- Push! Come on!

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.559
Ross, let's go!

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:14.199
- I'm gonna take my chances here.
- 'Ee'll never make it.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.719
Go! Row!

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.879
Fire!

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.279
- Halt in the name ofthe King!
VERCOE: Cut 'em off!

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.439
- Cut 'em off!
- Halt!

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.199
(Musket fire)

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.479
None ofthat.
You know the captain's orders.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.759
I have a little boy upstairs. He'll be frightened.
I must bring him down.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.239
- I can't allow that.
- Do you make war on babies now?

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.679
Get out of my way.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.759
- Is there a baby?
- Of course there is.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.039
Very well. But be quick about it.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.439
(Shouting)

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.319
(Musket fire)

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.079
You!

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.159
(Grunts)

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.919
(Breathes heavily)

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.719
- Demelza.
- Ross!

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.959
I thought...

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.119
- We need to get to the house.
- There's soldiers guarding it - McNeil.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.279
- Oh, damn it.
- Are you hurt?

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.799
No, it's just a scratch.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.919
(Distant shouting)

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.079
They're coming.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.039
Soldiers? At this time of night?

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.159
There must be some unrest.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:13.319
Why does Ross not answer my notes?
Has he no care for us at all?

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.519
He has his own family to protect.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.239
Then I must appeal for help elsewhere.

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.359
Go in through the kitchen.
I must get to the cache.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.719
Through the side door.
I have a key. Make haste.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.039
- Where have you been?
- Upstairs.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.999
- How did you get down?
- By the back stairs.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.559
- You never mentioned...
- I'm here. Isn't that enough?

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.719
(Rapid knocking at door)

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.399
He's in the library.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.039
Where is Captain Poldark?

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.879
- In St Ives, I believe.
- You believe wrong.

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.119
I saw him not ten minutes ago.
Has he come in here?

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.599
No-one has been in but you, sir.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.359
He's headed in this direction.
He'll be somewhere about.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.359
How dare you come breaking in here.
My husband will hear of it.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:13.119
And shortly, I trust. You will give us permission
to search the house?

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.279
I most certainly will not.

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.879
You've searched the cellars? No contraband?

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.199
- I told you that Ross was in St Ives.
- I wish I believed you.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.079
Search the outhouses and the stables.
I'll take the library.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.039
- The library, it is sometimes locked.
- No doubt you have a key.

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.119
(Door creaks)

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.359
Over here.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.039
Bring light.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.199
- Here it is.
- Just like he said.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.039
Give me the pistol, man.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.999
Guns at the ready.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.639
Vercoe?

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.399
Would you mind?

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.799
More light!

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.199
(Steady drizzle)

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.959
Are you shivering, my precious?

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.119
Perhaps we should go inside
before you catch a chill.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.839
- (Relieved sigh) They let you go.
- Finally. Now I must go to Caroline.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.519
- Pray God she'll understand.
- Of course she will.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.559
- And Ross?
- There's no sign of him.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.599
I cannot conceive where he would be.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.439
Not in the cache, at any rate.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.399
You won't forget us?

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:18.839
Never.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.479
Yaah! Hup!

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.599
(Sighs)

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.279
(Door opens)

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.919
Where's your father?

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.479
Where is he?

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.319
Where's your father, child?

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.479
Never fear. We won't hurt 'ee.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.519
Numbers?

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.599
He'll be counting his days
when I lay my hands on him.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.199
'Twas Charlie?

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.359
- The informer?
- 'Twas.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.799
JUD: Right, let's get after him.

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.759
I have a letter for you, sir.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.079
CAROLINE: DearDwight,
I have left for London with my uncle,

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.839
a move which cannot surprise you
afterthe foasco of last night.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:39.279
It is better this way. Ever  since we agreed
to elope, I have known of your struggle

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:43.919
between your infatuation for me
and your  real love - your  patients.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.719
Now you need no longer  worry
or give anything up.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.279
Except me. And that you have already done.

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.759
So, farewell, Dwight.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.799
I shall never  see you again.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.839
Your sincere friend,

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.999
Caroline Penvenen.

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.759
George, I've been worried out of my mind.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.039
- I haven't.
- There was a smuggling incident.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.239
- The military were out in force.
- A pity they've nothing better to do.

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.639
Though I'm told they had their eye
on a bigger prize. Your nephew.

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.479
- Ross?
- I'm not clear as to his precise involvement.

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.519
- Merely that he was involved.
- Stuff!

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.119
It baffles me why he considers himself
above the law,

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:34.199
exempt from the duty we law-abiding citizens
pay on legally-imported goods.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.839
- Piffle!
- Is it certain?

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.079
As it stands. He's disappeared. So...

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:40.719
On the run from justice.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:45.879
Oh, no doubt he'll live to fight
and offend another day, but, still...

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:49.039
I pity anyone who must depend on such a man.

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.159
He must have made it to the library.
The table had moved and the rug.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.039
- But if he'd no time to open the cache...
- Where could he be?

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.479
- (Distant talking)
- Soldiers!

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.839
The captain says to move out.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:43.479
JUD: So was he killed
or did he do the job hisself?

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:46.279
I reckon we'll never know.

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.559
(Grunts)

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.159
(Door opens)

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.119
Mistress Poldark was reassured?

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.639
I believe so.

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.279
(Clink of glasses)

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:26.439
I wonder she does not remarry.
A husband could offer her more protection.

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.239
He could. (Pours drink)

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.079
And he will. (Replaces stopper in decanter)

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.679
His hand was all bloody.

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.039
I can't stop thinking about it. What...?

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:00.919
What if it was worse than he thought? Or what if
he's lying bleeding to death somewhere?

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.079
Hush, maid, don't think such a thing.

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:37.799
(Plank scrapes floor)

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.359
DEMELZA: ♪ With your heart mating

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:12.759
♪ I'd hold a finger to my tongue

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:18.559
♪ I'd hold a finger waiting
