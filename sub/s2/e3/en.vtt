WEBVTT

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.959
(Cockerel crows)

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.399
Come on. (Whistles)

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.839
I applaud your foresight.
It's as well to be prepared.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.999
For what?

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.039
Any encounter?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.839
With those who might...wish us ill.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.879
Ross Poldark would not dare lay a finger on me.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.319
- Even though we tried to get him hanged?
- We failed. Did you forget?

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.879
Ah! But on that score,
there are other ways to choke a man.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.279
And ifthe rumours about his finances are true,
it shouldn't be difficult.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.839
I look forward to hearing of your progress.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.519
- (Knocking at door)
- Yes.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.159
Beggin' 'ee pardon, Cap'n, sur.
'Tis a letter for 'ee, sur, if it please 'ee, sur.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.999
Ah, the ole Trevorgie workings?
'Tis a fine thought, sur.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.879
What is?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.319
Whatever 'ee was thinkin', sur.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.399
I'm thinking ofthrashing you from here to Sawle.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.839
Aye, sur. Well, whatever 'ee say, sur,
much obliged, sur...

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.479
I write to remind you that your loan of £1 ,000

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.119
with interest at 40%
is shortly due for repayment.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.279
Yourfriend, Harris Pascoe.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.799
All I need.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.959
What is?

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.079
Jud.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.799
His grovelling is killing me.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.679
Are you away somewhere?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.239
To Truro.
For the Wheal Leisure shareholders' meeting.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.999
Oh, just since the trial, I've scarce seen you,
let alone had time to speak.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.959
You always seem about
some business or other.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.119
The mine? The harvest?

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.119
Would you have me neglect our affairs?

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.799
- No, Ross.
- We'll talk soon. I promise.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.079
Gentlemen, welcome to the quarterly meeting
ofthe Wheal Leisure shareholders.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.239
Now before we begin, I must make you aware

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.639
that Mrs Jacqueline Tregidden
has sold her shares to a Mr Coke.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.759
Since Mrs Tregidden has always trusted us
to do our business without her interference,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.199
let's hope this gentleman will do the same.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.359
- (Clears throat)
- (Knocking)

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.039
Good day t'you, gentlemen.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.079
My name is Tankard.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.479
Acting on behalf of Mr Coke.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.159
Mr Warleggan, more like.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.079
Pray go on with the business, sir.
I'm most eager to hear what you have to say.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.439
Oh, shield your eyes, my boy!

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.159
The dazzle ofWarleggan livery can blind a man!

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.199
George has invited us to a soirée.
I've sent our regrets.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.359
No, no. No. No, surely not?

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.159
Pray convey our delight
in declining his invitation.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.399
Now then, boy,
would you like to do your lessons...

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.319
- ..or help me in the fields?
- The fields!

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.599
The fields is the correct answer!

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.519
Gentlemen, it's been four years
since we opened Wheal Leisure.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.839
We started with 50 men, now we employ 100.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.719
We're not prosperous,
but we consistently show a small profit.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.199
We're not getting fat on it.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.599
But that could change if another lode of copper
could be found. Mr Henshawe?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.399
(Clears throat)

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.559
'Tis er...common knowledge
that the ancient Trevorgie workings,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.919
abandoned half a century ago
when the owner died

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.559
were never worked out.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.399
The old shafts caved in long ago.
'Tis impossible to reach from above grass.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.559
But if you look at this old map,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.439
and compare it with the current map
ofWheal Leisure workings

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.159
you'll see that we've extended considerably
in the direction of Trevorgie.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:38.359
My proposal is this: we divert our quarterly
profits into starting an exploratory tunnel

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.799
to see ifwe can join up the old Trevorgie
workings and access the untapped copper.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.759
And who's to do the digging?

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.719
Will it take men away
from the day-to-day workings?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.639
Can you guarantee that copper will be found?

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.159
How will this affect my client's dividends?

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.759
As you know, sir,
there are no guarantees in mining.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.799
Mr Henshawe
will personally supervise the venture.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.999
A small team, including myself,
will be led by Zacky Martin.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.639
And we take on six extra men to cover them.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.399
Well, I can't see the harm of it.
I doubt their wages'll bankrupt us!

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.599
Ye can be sure ofthat!

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.159
I'm in favour.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.319
Who's with me?

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.479
Motion carried.
Mr Aukitt and Mr Tankard declined.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.639
(Galloping horse approaching)

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.759
Captain McNeil!

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.719
Mistress Poldark! Have you recovered
from your husband's ordeal?

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.839
I give thanks daily for his acquittal, sir.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.999
Doubtless he's a wiser man for it?

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.799
No more sailing close to the wind?

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.159
- You know Ross.
- Mm.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.599
- Is he home?
- In town.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.479
I'm in the neighbourhood
at the behest of Unwin Trevaunance,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.159
advising on matters of local security.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.919
But I trust I may drop in and take a glass of rum
with my old army comrade?

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.279
Or indeed my old comrade's wife.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.399
- Allow me, ma'am.
- Oh.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.639
Thank you.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.559
George Warleggan
finally has a spy in the camp.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.599
It was bound to happen eventually.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.319
But provided the other shareholders hold firm,
Tankard and George can be kept in check.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.639
It's the last thing 'ee need now,
with all the rumours goin' about.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.759
- Rumours?
- The parlous state o' your finances?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.479
Have people nothing better to gossip about?

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.519
You'll have to excuse me, gentlemen.
I'll see you tonight at the mine.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.799
When's the last time 'ee took a day off?

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.759
When I sat in jail, awaiting trial.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.879
Cap'n Ross be 'ome soon, I bla'.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.239
I hope so, seeing as Captain McNeil
has called 'specially to see him.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.359
Hmm!

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.639
Your health, ma'am.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.199
In truth, 'twas also you I wished to see.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.559
On account of your skill at cow doctoring.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.599
I've no such thing, sir.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.079
Sir Hugh Bodrugan has heard different.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.239
His prize cow Sheba is sick.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.479
He'd esteem it the greatest offavours

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.239
if you'd cast your eye over the beast
and prescribe a remedy.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.879
He asked for you particularly.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.159
- I don't doubt it.
- May I tell him that he need not hope in vain?

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.719
Captain McNeil?

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.159
An ambush, sir!
Caught off guard and in possession ofthe field!

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.199
How are you, sir?

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.439
On manoeuvres hereabouts?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.439
Quartered with Sir Hugh at Werry House.
Whither I'm attempting to lure your wife.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.919
To what end?

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.839
Sir Hugh wants me to tend to his cow,
though I say I've no skill.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.439
Can I persuade you
to lend your wife to such a cause?

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.679
Demelza has a mind of her own, sir,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.399
but since she has a special fondness
for Sir Hugh, no doubt she'll be over directly.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.559
Ifyou'll excuse me,
I have mine figures to attend to.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.999
Look, Horace, what beastly little hovels.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.159
Who could bear to live here?

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.439
I urge you to quit this place
and come to London,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.119
then loathsome sights need not distress you.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.559
I did not say I found
all the sights loathsome hereabouts.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.039
Well done, my boy.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.559
He's not been right
since he returned from Bodmin.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.799
He is changed.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.639
And I do not know how or why.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.479
But we must be glad of it.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.999
Elizabeth Poldark "regrets".
This is Francis's doing.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.759
Why er...waste your time on these people?
Surely Unwin is of more use?

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.599
Unwin is proving less of an asset than I'd hoped.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.639
All manner of promises
made in exchange for votes

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.599
and I'm beginning to fear they're wasted.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.399
What's the use of having an MP in your pocket
if he's too obtuse to do your bidding?

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.439
He is pliable.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.479
Is that not an asset?

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.159
Only if yoked to wit and intelligence,
which in this case it is not.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.199
How was the meeting?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.799
- Illuminating.
- Tell me.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.399
But first, summon Tom Harry. There's another
small matter regarding Poldark's manservant.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.399
When 'Is Worshipfulness the judge
he says to me, "Mester Paynter", he sez...

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.119
"Did this man do wrong or no?"

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.079
And I sez, "Sithee Your Honourableness,

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:32.919
Ross Poldark is as innocent
as a newly-dropped babe in its first wettels."

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.839
And sez 'Is Majestic Horribleness...

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.759
"Mester Paynter, 'tis your testimony...

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.359
..an' your testormy alone 'ave set this man free."

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.159
Did you mislay your manners?
Leavin' me alone to deal with our guest?

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.319
You appeared to be handling him admirably.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.799
- I felt like an intruder.
- Meaning what?

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.479
Demelza, do you really suppose
he wants you to cure Bodrugan's cow?

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.519
He makes his intentions very plain.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.079
I think I ought to be able to judge that for myself.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.439
No doubt you think so,
just be careful his uniform doesn't dazzle you.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.079
- It has that effect on some people.
- Especially a common miner's daughter?

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.039
That's for you to demonstrate.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.599
You are detestable sayin' that.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.079
- I'm sure I didn't start this argument.
- No, but you never do!

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.039
You just give me the cold shoulder
and sour looks

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.719
an' despise everything that isn't
up to your high-an'-mighty standards!

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.039
(Barking)

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.199
- What 'ee bin sayin' t'upset the maid?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.999
Demelza?

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.959
Are you well?

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.599
Quite well, thank 'ee.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.639
I came in search of Garrick.
He scented a rabbit an'...

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.319
Garrick! Garrick, come to!

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.879
Is Ross recovered from the trial?

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.759
He rarely speaks of it.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.159
And your news? The child?

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.879
Is he pleased?

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.239
Not exactly.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.919
You've not told him.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.079
He don't wish for another.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.919
Since Julia, he...

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.599
..he haven't the heart for it.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.599
And we're to blame.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.639
'Tis not my b'lief.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.479
It's good of you to say so.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.919
But the fact that there's still discord
between our families.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.639
There is. An' I think 'twill not be lightly set aside.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.279
By Ross at least.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.599
Garrick!

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.799
When we strike,
it must be clean and swift and out of sight.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.199
Giss on, man, you're talkin' to the master now.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.039
Gentlemen. A good night's work?

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.199
A good deal nearer Trevorgie
than this time yesterday.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.159
- Go home and get some rest.
- None ofthat for the wicked!

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:34.599
It's home to breakfast then away to Truro.
My finances require urgent attention.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.919
(Door opens and closes)

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.999
- Demelza?
- Ross.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.039
(Sighs) You first.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.199
No, you.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.559
I want to apologise.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.159
I've been distracted of late.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.039
But there are things
I've been wishing to say to you.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.199
- And I you.
- About our finances.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.239
Oh.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.599
My shares in Wheal Leisure
are the only thing of value we have.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.279
I've begun work in this new tunnel to try
and improve our chances ofthe mine

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.879
becoming more profitable,
but still, our own coffers are almost bare.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.919
It doesn't need to be like that.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.199
You're head purser at the mine.
Why won't you take a wage?

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.839
I prefer to plough every last penny into the mine.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.039
We have, however, a more pressing concern.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.919
Last year I asked Pascoe
to find me a loan of£1 ,000.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.039
The interest at 40% is due this week.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.079
£400?

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.119
Yes.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.919
How is half such a sum to be found?

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.959
What's to be done?

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:07.479
Ride to Truro, see if Pascoe's managed
to get the loan extended for another year?

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.599
In the meantime, the more I work in the mine,
the better our chances of reaching Trevorgie.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.519
And the interest?

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.999
Look about you.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.159
See what you can bear to part with.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.639
Then look again.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.679
Ah, Mistress Demelza.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.559
- Have you come to steal my heart?
- (Laughs)

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.599
- No, sir. I've come to visit your cow.
- Oh.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.199
It wasn't easy but I've secured agreement
for your loan to be extended for another year.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.919
At the same exorbitant rate.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.759
Provided...this year's interest
is forthcoming tomorrow.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.079
A mere £400.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.239
Quite so.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.399
She d'look fair sick, Sir Hugh.
What treatment has she had?

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.199
Well, all manner of blisters, clysters,
salves and poultices. All to no avail.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.919
But I've no doubt you'll offer better advice.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.399
I will.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.319
Start afresh with a better beast.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.079
- How went the shareholders' meeting?
- Well enough.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.319
- But for the appearance of a new shareholder.
- Tankard? The Warleggan proxy?

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.159
You heard.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.239
Are they on a mission to own the company?

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.279
No, sir.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.079
Just to own me.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.799
This cow you speak of, your Emma...

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.159
Oh, she's our pride an' joy, sir.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.159
So we could not let her go
except at a goodly price.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.239
Oh, well, not ifthe rumours be true.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.239
Your husband's financial difficulties?

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.479
Of course I...I'm always happy to help a friend.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.879
And I could be persuaded
to pay the "goodly price"...

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.759
..ifthe terms were right.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.639
And what terms would you require?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.879
Oh, merely a...a kind of interest.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.599
Payable here and here.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.919
- And here!
- Sir Hugh! You forget yourself!

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.759
- On the contrary.
- Judas, I think my dog has better manners!

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.199
- Woof! Woof!
- Sir Hugh.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.439
I believe you're wanted at the house.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.479
Urgently.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.279
Hmm. (Chuckles)

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.199
Sir Hugh's a mite unruly sometimes.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.799
Should you decide to brave his company again,

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.039
I will personally undertake to protect you
from his enthusiasm.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.839
I'm much obliged, sir.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.319
I'm not overjoyed to think of Sir Hugh
in possession of Emma.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.999
No, nor I, but you said she must be sold
and I've secured a buyer.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.119
So what else must go?

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.239
Well, not the oxen.
Without them we cannot plough.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.159
But the pigs, the chickens.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.199
- The clock.
- The carpet.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.239
The settle.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.399
At least one chair.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.639
My brooch is worth £100.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.799
That was a gift.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.199
But it may need to be sold in the end.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.959
I wonder what Garrick
could fetch on the open market?

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.639
One overgrown mongrel? Carnivorous.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.199
- Crockery breaker.
- And stealer of pies.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.399
D'you suppose there'd be any takers?

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.679
(Rumble ofthunder)

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.519
(Chickens clucking)

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.759
May I fetch you anything from market, Uncle?

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.879
You're going in with Unwin, are you?

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.679
Good Lord, no.
I'm in need of some sensible conversation.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.799
Well, then, Hicks must escort you.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.319
Caroline, you cannot be roaming
about the countryside unaccompanied.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.039
No, Uncle.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.479
But if I were to go, what could I bring you?

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.439
Sugared almonds? Marzipan?

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.999
You spoil your old uncle.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.439
(Both chuckle)

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.999
(Market traders call out)

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.519
(Chatter)

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.039
Dr Enys!

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.639
What a lucky encounter.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.679
How are you, Miss Penvenen?

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.839
I have a tingling in my throat.
Do you think it could be serious?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.479
I very much doubt it.
You seem otherwise in the peak of health.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.119
I hope it's not morbus strangulatorius?

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.639
If it were the putrid throat, you'd soon know it.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.879
Is that what Ross Poldark's daughter had?
He's not exactly blessed with luck, is he?

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.359
No. And that doesn't seem about to change.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.839
How humiliating it must be for him.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.599
- Less for her, I suppose.
- I doubt either ofthem see it that way.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.159
Would you excuse me, ma'am?
I have patients to see to.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:08.919
(Soundtrack over dialogue)

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.839
Mistress Poldark.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.879
Ross.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.479
How are you?

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.159
You don't look at all well.
Can it be the anxieties ofthe trial?

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.079
Nor you, George.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.119
- Could you have had some disappointment?
- None that I know of.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.399
Perhaps it is yet to come.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.639
Ross.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.079
How did you manage it?

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.159
It was quite straightforward.
We sold pretty much everything we own.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.959
You see, a real horse is much better
than a hobby horse, is it not?

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.759
Why does Uncle George not visit us any more?

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.799
Uncle George is not our friend.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.439
Is Uncle Ross our friend?

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.439
In time...

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.519
in time I hope he will be.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.439
You're quite the favourite with Mrs Tabb
these days. She cannot abide Dr Choake.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.279
I suspect she prefers
the cheapness of my remedies.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.239
Or possibly their efficacy?

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.439
Aunt Agatha,
Dr Enys has agreed to take tea with us.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.919
You know how she loves to hear
ofthe latest dread diseases.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.919
Is it my imagination
or is Francis in better spirits these days?

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.119
Scrofula. That's it.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.599
Great purple blotches
and swellings ofthe neck.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.959
Since the trial, you would not know him.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.079
I cannot tell if it's because Ross was saved

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.999
or if something happened
while he was in Bodmin.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.679
He shared your room...the night before the trial.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.959
Did you notice any strangeness
in mood or behaviour?

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.119
Not that I can recall.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.159
Something he said, I had the feeling...

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.079
You may think me callous or hysterical,

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.159
but I could almost believe that Francis
had intended to kill himself.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.399
Did he?

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.599
Whatever occurred, be glad of it.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.239
He came to town a broken man.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.359
He returned...

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.479
like that.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.399
(Rustling)

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.719
Mr Paynter!

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.959
Who, sur? Me, sur?

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.439
Nay, not I, sur.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.799
You will recall the bargain
we struck some time ago?

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.839
Bargain?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.879
I never struck no such thing.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.919
I don't hold with 'em, does I?

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.719
In exchange for testifying against Ross Poldark.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.319
Nay, p'raps I do recall something.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:50.199
Thinkin' it over, I wasn't meself in court.
Mebbe it slipped my mind.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.879
In which case 'tis on'y fair
to give 'ee back yer guineas.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.039
- Ten, were it?
- 15.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.679
But that is not what we have come for.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.999
For what, then?

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.839
This.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.519
Argh!

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.919
(Jud groans)

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.079
(Beating continues)

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.479
You see much of Ross and Demelza?

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.639
Why do you ask?

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.559
I so wish our families could be reconciled,
but Ross is determined to keep his distance.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.199
I wonder...might I ask you to speak to them
on our behalf?

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.799
What could I say?

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:38.119
Francis is to give a supper when the harvest
is in to our tenants and friends.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.919
Would you ask Ross and Demelza to join us?

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.759
To stay the night? You, too, are most welcome.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.079
I'll happily carry the invitation.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.959
I cannot guarantee how it will be received.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.399
DEMELZA: Sorry, it's not much.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.839
Mmm.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.399
Ross...

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:15.599
I've been wantin' to speak of somethin',
but haven't yet found the right moment.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.239
- Surgeon's 'ere.
- Oh!

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.879
- Dwight.
- Hope 'ee's eaten afore!

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.919
Admiring our harvest?

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.719
I hope to augment it.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.559
With an invitation.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.519
Oh?

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.679
From Trenwith.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.799
Obviously we won't accept.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.879
Surely we can't forget
that it's thanks to them that we lost Julia?

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.919
Or that George is still their bosom friend?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.319
- Is he?
- You'd have us overlook it?

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.999
Have I said that? No, in truth,
I'm in no haste to go to Trenwith.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.559
Then we're in accord.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.159
It do appear so.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.319
(Prudie shrieks)

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.359
He'm dead!

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.279
He'm dead. He'm mortal dead!

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.879
Who could have done such a thing?

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.319
He 'ad no enemies.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:29.719
He were the sweetest, kindliest,
most peaceable cove a body could meet.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.039
An' ne'r a cross word did pass 'is lips.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.079
An' now I left a widow, all forlorn,

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.239
without a penny in the world...

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.079
..not e'en to bury the poor soul, God rest it!

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.239
There is this.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.119
When we moved 'im, they fell out of his pockets.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.119
Gold sov'reigns? Gold sov'reigns?

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.719
- Where'd 'ee get such...?
- Where indeed?

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.119
Why, the mizzerly, mazzerly stinkin', black worm!
He had 'em about 'im an' never tell'd me?

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.279
- Reckon 'tis from the Trade?
- That's unlikely.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.159
I'll knock 'im sideways
down Stippy-Stappy Lane!

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.199
Then give 'im a rare good buryin'.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.599
Rum an' vittles...

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.559
..hymns an' viols,
widow's weeds for poor ole Prudie.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.719
'Tis a matter of lookin' respectable, 'tis.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.119
We must send the ole man offfitty ways.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.599
ROSS: I've known him since I was a child.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.479
He was the most useless servant under the sun.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.959
But he taught me to smoke a pipe...

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.999
..and cheat at Loo.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.599
They left the money.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.359
Yes?

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.399
Then it was no random attack.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.559
What, then?

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.679
Vengeance?

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.039
- What for?
- You were in court.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.879
You heard his original statement.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.039
He was ready to testify against me.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.559
But then he did not.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.879
What if he was paid to speak against me -

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.399
hence the 15 guineas,
and then changed his mind?

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.879
ROSS: George has played us all.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.799
Would George wreck all that we have?

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.559
The family, the business, and now our servant?

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.559
That seems to be his aim.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.119
DEMELZA: Can we do nothing?

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.439
ROSS: It suits George
to have myself and Francis at odds.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.879
Perhaps we should accept
the invitation to Trenwith.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.759
DEMELZA: Are you sure, Ross?

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.919
Some things cannot be mended.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.959
But some can.

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.719
(Cries out)

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.679
(Elizabeth laughs)

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.519
This is your doing?

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.839
You're not displeased?

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.799
Far from it.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.799
Cousin.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.799
It's an unexpected pleasure.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.599
Thank you for bringing him.
It means the world to Francis.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.039
You look well, cousin.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.239
- Demelza.
- Francis.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.399
Welcome.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.919
I 'ave 'n! I 'ave 'n!

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.959
- I 'ave 'n!
ALL: What 'ave 'ee?

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.999
What 'ave 'ee? What 'ave 'ee?

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.039
A neck! A neck!

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.199
- A neck!
ALL: Hurrah!

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.359
Hurrah! Hurrah!

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.239
Elizabeth.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.199
I was expecting a small, private gathering.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.519
Instead I find myself ambushed by san-culottes.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.279
Hardly, Mama.
These are our tenants and friends.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.559
Trust me, a few crusts will not curry favour
when they turn on you.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.759
Ask the Marquis de Launay,
ifyou can find his head.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.239
You look radiant, mater-in-law.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.679
- Are you quite well, Francis?
- Never better.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.439
Come, then, friends!
Shall we have some dancing?

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.479
Yes, I think we shall.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.639
(Jaunty tune)

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.519
I ordered you to scare him,
not assassinate him.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.919
- Tom got a little carried away.
- This is disastrous.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.959
- You think Poldark will know who's behind it?
- I wouldn't be surprised if he's outside now!

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.879
(Knocking)

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.079
How d'you like my new coat? I ordered my tailor
to make it the double of Prinny's!

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.119
You most definitely need one, George.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.799
Well, can we go to the Penvenen party?
My intended will be impatient to see me.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.239
By all means.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.039
RAY PENVENEN: Caroline? (Knocks)

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.999
Come in.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.719
Caroline, my dear? Are you ready yet?
Our guests will be arriving soon.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.759
I have such a pain.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.359
But Tom Choake was here just now.
Did he not bleed you?

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.679
Would you have me submit to his butchery?

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.879
So what do you propose?

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.279
FRANCIS: This is the last bottle ofthe '83.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.199
After that, we'll have to resort to cheap gin.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.079
Did you hear I quarrelled with George?

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.119
No.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.159
What was the cause?

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.839
Oh, these things tend to sink in slowly.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.759
At first you barely notice,
and then one day you wake up to the realisation

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.759
that the man who has been
your friend for years...

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.079
..is a complete and utter blackguard.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.359
Well, I don't disagree. Indeed, I strongly believe
he's behind the assault on Jud.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.959
- What will you do?
- Till I can prove it...

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.999
nothing.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.119
But when I do...

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.439
- A letter for you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.519
Someone taken ill at Killewarren.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.839
Tell them to be ill at a more convenient time.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.479
It's a complaint ofthe throat.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.119
I must go.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.159
Elizabeth, where's my port?

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:33.159
Lady Whitworth says that fashions in London
and Bath are now verging on the indecent.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.479
What exactly does that mean?

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.399
Bosoms.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.519
Acres of 'em -
exposed like capons on a platter!

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.119
You look pale, child.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.399
- Are you unwell?
- No.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.039
No, that is, I believe
I may be sickenin' for something.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.479
Get Elizabeth to mix you a rouge.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.239
Elizabeth goes out so seldom,
she has no need of it.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.199
It's criminal that this should be the highlight
of your social calendar, Elizabeth.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.679
I know I would be driven quite mad

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.519
had I only farmhands and kitchen maids
to converse with.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.879
If you'll beg my pardon,
I must take a breath of air.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.279
(String quartet plays)

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.159
Damn it, I'm partial to a harvest supper.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.399
Gladdens the heart
to enjoy the fruits of one's own labours!

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:47.599
Remind me when you were last in your fields
with a scythe, sir?

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.799
Is Miss Penvenen not here?

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.479
Nor her uncle. Most irregular.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.639
Invited to supper and not a sign ofthe hosts.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.679
Shall we hunt them down?

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.719
Ah, McNeil, what news?

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.879
Can we rest easy in our beds,
knowing you've purged the district of violence?

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.919
I lay claim to no such thing, sir.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.319
Only last night
we had a murder on our doorstep.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.439
- Surely not?
- Captain Poldark's manservant.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.919
Paul Daniel? Where 'ee be?

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.479
Do 'ee go draw the spigot
on the next keg o' brandy.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.199
I've an urge to address the conflagration!

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:31.879
Jud Paynter... 'ee were a whited sepulchre.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:37.159
But now 'ee's passed on
to flowery fields and green meads.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.119
When Paul Daniel come back,
we'll raise a toast an' send 'im on his way.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.639
- 'Ee's gone.
- We know that, fool!

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.239
From his slab! 'Tis empty!

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.639
The corpse ain't there!

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.999
(Screams)

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.479
(Woman approaching wailing)

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.759
- What is it? What is it?
- 'Tis they body-stealers!

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.559
They've robbed me o' my ole man!

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.319
Oh.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.439
(Laughter and chatter)

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.079
Ah.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.759
My niece has been ill for three days.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.279
Dr Choake attended her, of course,
but she grows worse

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.679
and she insisted on sending for you.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.519
Did Dr Choake attempt a diagnosis?

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.239
Quinsy.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.639
- With or without fever?
- Without.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.439
- But she can hardly swallow.
- Is it the putrid throat?

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.879
That we will shortly ascertain.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.159
Will you open your mouth? Please?

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.679
Might a servant fetch me
some warm water and salt?

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.479
I'll see it done directly.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.679
I think I might be able to help you,
but you must keep absolutely still.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.839
Can you do that?

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.839
- Adams or Wyatt?
- For what?

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.159
Our house in London.
Caroline will want the latest thing.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.199
She can well afford it.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.239
I wonder whether it shouldn't be Wyatt?

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.879
His Pantheon in Oxford Street
has pleasing dimensions.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.159
Perhaps you'd better secure the lady
before you start spending her fortune.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.199
Mr Aukitt.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.759
Excuse me.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.879
Remind me,
do you still have shares in Wheal Leisure?

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.279
Yes, I do.

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.999
May I tell you a secret?

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.999
Old Fred Pendarves.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.039
He's a mine captain
at Grambler in my father's day.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.559
For a month now
I've had him prospecting over my land.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.479
To what end?

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.519
Ross, you know I'll never make a farmer.
It's mining.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.559
Mining. It's what I keep coming back to.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.919
That's what he wanted for me.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.079
God knows he'd be as surprised as me to think
that any ofwhat he taught me had sunk in.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.239
But...that's the truth of it.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.119
We must start mining again.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.199
Don't let me deter you,
but even a hole in the ground costs money.

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.519
I have money. A few hundred put by.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:15.119
Ifthings had gone badly at the trial,
I would have given it to Demelza.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.839
Now I'm...

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.559
I'm minded to spend it
on a final attempt to secure my own destiny.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.479
If only to spite George.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:31.879
I think the best revenge is to succeed
in your own right, despite his interventions.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.039
Almost there.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.919
- (Gasps)
- All done.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.399
Now rinse your mouth with salt water.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.199
It'll get easier now.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.999
What did you do?

00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.799
When did you last eat fish, Miss Penvenen?

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.879
Three days ago.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.039
You must be more careful in future.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.319
A fish bone.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.879
Can I do anything for Horace while I'm here?

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.399
WOMAN: Whoops!

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.319
- Mr Aukitt?
- Can you help?

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.519
- What ails him?
- A fatal gaming encounter.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.679
I doubt you can save him. (Laughs)

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.319
- The ladies have deserted us.
- Yes.

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.239
ROSS: Perhaps we bore them.
- Perhaps.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.079
I think I must go to bed.
I find I'm less able to hold my liquor these days.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.839
No, no, stay, finish your drink.

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.079
Thank you, cousin.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.159
For what?

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.519
I never thought to see you under my roof again.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.719
I never thought to be here.

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.439
(Wails)

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.799
(Sobs)

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.479
'Tis the shame of it!

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:36.519
To 'ave an husband, an' to not 'ave an husband.
I'll never live it down.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.559
Ssh now.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:42.399
Then there's the buryin'.
'Ee can't 'ave a buryin' without a body.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.599
No.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.679
So not only am I' robbed of a husband,

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.079
I'm robbed o' the pleasure
of seein' 'im planted in the ground!

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.199
(Gasps of shock)

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.999
(Gasps)

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:13.719
- Miss Penvenen, I trust you are on the mend?
- I believe I am, sir.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.679
Ah.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.119
Have I missed all the fun?

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.199
You appear to have had some of your own.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.159
Oh. It must be the ride and the night air.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.479
- Was it the putrid throat?
- Thankfully not.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:35.999
I did have to sedate William Aukitt though.
He was so agitated he could barely speak.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.039
What ailed him?

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.079
A fit ofthe Warleggans?

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.999
He'd been talking to George,
and before he knew it,

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.839
he'd signed away some shares
in a mining venture.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.239
He did not specify Wheal Leisure.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.399
Did George look happy?

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:52.519
Yes.

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.159
So 'ee was lyin' on the table...

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:05.559
And I wakes up in me winding sheet
wi' a terrible thirst, dreamin' o' gin.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:10.919
So off I carts to Jake's kiddley for some ale,
an' what 'appens?

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:16.199
Ther's all up an' screaming like stuck pigs,

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.239
and fallin' o'er each other to get out the door.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.399
So in I goes, drink me fill...

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.919
..an' when I come 'ome to Prudie...

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.959
An' what do I find?

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.519
All fligged out in fancy widow's weeds.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:34.839
An' folk-feastin' an' drinkin', at my expense.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.959
An' nought left
but a jug o' brandy an' a windin' sheet!

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.799
Tidn' fit, tidn' right, tidn' fair, tidn' proper!

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:49.839
Truly I say unto thee,
a prophet is never honoured in 'is own land.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.559
Oh! Ross.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.559
I thought everyone had retired.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.599
I thought so, too.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.199
Is Demelza about?

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:24.719
I think she was feeling unwell and went up early.
I thought I'd clear up.

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.359
Let me help you.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.039
I must thank you for coming.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.079
It was a good day.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.119
Heaven knows how we've paid for it.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.159
But Francis was insistent.

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.759
The Poldarks have fallen low.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.319
You must be sorry you married into the family.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:55.599
Do you think I should answer that?

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.759
Perhaps I should not have asked it?

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.839
Francis tells me he has some money put by.

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.879
I'm surprised
he doesn't use it for this household.

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.279
Oh, no, he's quite adamant.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:25.199
It's a "special sum"
to be used for a "special purpose".

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.639
- Does George know he has it?
- George gave it to him.

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.079
Did he?

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:35.039
In recompense for his gaming losses
to Matthew Sanson.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.079
- D'you believe that?
- Should I not?

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.039
George is not known for his philanthropy.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.119
But Francis is changed.

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.479
Yes.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.479
And you, I think.

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.959
For the better?

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.999
I wouldn't go that far.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:00.079
I remember a time you were already perfect.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.199
To me, I mean.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.159
ELIZABETH: That was long ago.

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.319
And you've been more than happy since.

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.479
With Demelza.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.639
And you've grown up.

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.519
Not too much, I hope.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.679
Today in the fields...

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.279
you looked like a girl of 16.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.559
Your age when I first knew you.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.159
These past months have changed me...

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.159
..has made me appreciate
what I have rather than what I lack.

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.199
ROSS: It's very wise.

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.039
After all, there's no point thinking about
what might have been.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.959
But you and I
would never have been happy together.

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.839
Our characters are too different.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.999
True.

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.519
But cannot love overcome such obstacles?

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.439
And surely there's a greater impediment.

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.799
You're a lady.
You could never have played the scullery maid.

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.519
- Perhaps I have hidden talents.
- I don't dispute that.

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:14.119
For somehow you've managed
to bring the light back to Francis's eyes.

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.279
I cannot imagine how.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.999
Can you not?

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.399
You should go to bed, Ross.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.319
Demelza will be thinking you've gone astray.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.399
Good night, then.

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.719
You're awake?

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.639
I thought you'd retired long ago.

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.799
I went out.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.679
Out?

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.719
Prudie came.

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.879
Jud's alive.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.879
What?

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.199
At least until Prudie do kill 'im again.

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.359
Jud's alive?

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.079
What happened? How?

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.119
Oh, ask me tomorrow. I'm weary to the bone.

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.199
Are you sure?

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.359
I did see him with my own eyes.

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:48.479
Elizabeth looked well tonight.

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:52.439
She did.

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.599
Her mother thinks
that were she not wed to Francis,

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:01.119
she'd have halfthe aristocracy at her feet.

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.279
But she is wed to Francis.

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.439
And she seems content to be so.

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.559
Do you remember our last visit here?

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.359
That Christmas?

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.159
When you first told me you loved me.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.999
And you told me you were with child.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.479
'Twas different then.

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.679
You were glad I was with child.

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.839
We were in our first days of love.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.159
And you would never have
looked twice at another woman.

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.199
Oh, Demelza...

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:52.879
What man does not
occasionally look at another woman?

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.159
Or woman occasionally look at another man?

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.119
And what man or woman of sense

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:03.119
does not have qualms
about bringing a child into the world?

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.999
Demelza?

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.679
Yes, Ross?

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.679
Yes, Ross.

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:28.999
An' I know that you don't want it.
An' I know its just another burden to you.

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:33.079
But there's no preventing it now,
so all we can do is...

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.119
How long have you known?

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.159
Since the trial.

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.599
Good God.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.199
- And not to tell me?
- You said you didn't want another after Julia.

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.679
Nor did I. Nor do I.

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:53.319
The very thought of it, a child to grow
into our hearts and then be lost to us again?

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.799
Could you bear it?

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.959
I could not.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.199
But if a child is coming...

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.999
..that's different.

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.759
A child is not a thought.

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.199
It is flesh and blood.

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.199
And if you can risk your heart again...

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.999
I can.

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.439
Then so can I.
