WEBVTT

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.359
(Waves roll and rumble)

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.399
(Children laugh)

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.799
(Rhythmic pounding ofwaves)

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.759
- Father would be amazed.
- At our new engine?

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.559
At my reading matter.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.519
I think he would approve of both.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.519
(Hissing and clanking)

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.799
Trevithick makes bold claims for this engine.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.399
50 fathoms.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.679
- Can it really drain so deep?
- I hope so.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.399
We've just sunk the last of our capital into it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.039
Free trading is a capital offence.
Take him to Truro Gaol! Stand aside!

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.199
No, no!

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.319
- Ted!
- Go on!

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.039
Ted!

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.159
Go on!

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.879
- Where were they caught?
- Tregunna Cove.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.399
- Tregunna?
- You may well be surprised!

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.039
- Last place anyone'd expect a landing.
- 'Tis why we chose it.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.759
'Tis full o' rocks an' teasy currents.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.519
So was itjust ill luck?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.039
Or did someone betray us?

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.319
Gentlemen, it is a pleasure to have you with us
on our adventure.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.199
Pleasure's ours, Mr Poldark.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.759
The joy's gone out of Leisure
since George Warleggan acquired more shares.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.759
- There's talk o' lower earnings, even closures.
- That won't happen while I have a stake.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.879
Your stake is now so small as to be insignificant.
As is mine.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.679
All we can do is take our dividends
and watch others make decisions.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.559
Now our affections lie with Grace.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.039
She may be temperamental,
but at least she's ours. Shall we go to work?

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.719
Sir?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.559
Thank you.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.119
Ted Carkeek's been arrested.
He's in court this afernoon.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.159
I must go.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.359
My knee still pains me, sir.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.119
- All the time?
- Only when it go stiff.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.359
'Tis like someone turn a key an' lock it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.559
Dr Choake did advise to...cut it off.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.039
A convenient solution, Charlie. For him.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.399
(Groans)

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.679
I want you to keep it bound for a week
until I come to see you again.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.399
I don't see it's needful
for you to be fiddlin' with it so oft.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.199
Rosina would get along fine as she is.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.279
If I can help your daughter, that's surely
a good thing, is it not, Mr Hoblyn?

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.639
- Will any ofyou go to court?
- An' see Ted sent for transportation?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.519
- Ha! Or worse.
- Don't say that!

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.359
'Tis gauger Vercoe to blame.
He'll not turn a blind eye.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.599
- There's talk of an informer.
- Since when?

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.159
Mr Trencrom sent word today.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.679
An' t'ain't like Trencrom to raise false alarm.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.639
- But who could it be?
- Trencrom say it could be anyone.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.359
Do I look distinguished?

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.919
Perhaps you should be aiming for "severe".

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.839
Is that the best way to help Ted, I wonder?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.839
Mighty fligged out for the mine, Francis!

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.959
- I'm due in court, Aunt.
- On what charge?

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.399
Carrying out my duties as a magistrate.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.359
Come, Master Jeremy,
let's have you scrubbed up.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.239
Ross, I don' think you should go.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.879
Ted is one of my tenants - and workers.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.439
And a fellow free trader!

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.879
How will it look if you're seen to sympathise?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.199
As if you're involved - which you are.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.399
Three drops in our cove already this year.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.319
But this was not our cove.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.999
- And no one can point the finger.
- Yet.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.479
What would you have me do?

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.039
Not go to court.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.639
And tell Trencrom
he may no longer use our cove.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.439
And save himself our fee?

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.719
So we have even less coming in?
Is that what you want?

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.119
Are you not afeared?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.399
To think o' one of our own betrayin' us?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.679
Of course, I'm concerned. I'll be on my guard.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.439
I will look twice at even our closest friends.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.719
- But still go to court?
- I think I must.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.679
I'll fetch my hat.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.879
Was that a yawn, Horace?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.199
Shall you find this place awfully dreary
afer a year in London?

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.439
We needn't stay long,
once our engagement's announced tonight.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.479
- Uncle Ray.
- Caroline, my dear.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.399
Well, are you ready to embrace your fate?

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.879
Do you suppose Mrs Figg
has any marzipan for Horace?

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.599
Shall we ride to Truro and find some for you?

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.199
(Dog yaps)

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.759
So...she has agreed to your engagement?

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.279
Well, I think so.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.319
Unwin, I seldom entertain.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.439
And the sole reason for tonight's dinner
is to make an announcement.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.159
You'd better be sure there is one.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.079
(Coughing)

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.279
That cough has worsened, Aunt.
Would you have me call Dr Choake?

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.279
If I wished to be bled to death.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.759
(Coughs) I've... I've already sent for someone.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.319
Dr Enys?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.799
Someone far more sensible!

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.999
(Bell rings, people chatter)

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.879
An' that conclude my evidence, Your Worship.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.799
Only to add that I hope 'ee see fit
to send these men to the gallows.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.719
For how else may we break our shores
ofthis iniquitous trade?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.239
We thank you for your diligence, Mr Vercoe.
You may stand down.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.879
- A straightforward case, I think?
- Hmm.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.239
In the context ofthe monstrous events
still unfolding in France?

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.879
- I agree with you.
- My concern...

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.719
Which I share, is...

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.599
how to balance severity ofjudgment
with the appearance of mercy.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.559
The appearance of mercy?

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.319
For as you say, our duty is to allay rebellion,
not stoke it.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.119
- But the punishment...
- Oh, I agree.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.239
It should not be a crown ofthorns
for them to wear with pride.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.879
Yet ifthey wish to make martyrs ofthemselves...

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.759
Then let us disappoint them.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.879
We both know the type.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.919
- Bone idle.
- One has only to look at them.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.199
Then let us sentence them
to the last thing that they would seek.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.199
Ignominious...backbreaking...

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.599
..without a shred of honour.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.479
Sentenced...to three months' hard labour.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.039
(Murmuring)

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.199
ROSS:
I take my hat offto you, Francis.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.759
You played him at his own game.
Something I've never achieved!

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.639
Can you live with yourself?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.879
Oh, I think so.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.559
I know for a fact that Halse has brandy
in his cellar which came from such a run.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.479
Don't let that reassure you.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.479
With an informer at large, this won't be the last
case which comes before the court.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.999
And our friend Halse will be keen
to make the next man pay.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.719
Dr Enys. How fares our little backwater?

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.239
- A good deal duller than London, I imagine.
- Hmm, you imagine right.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.119
Having just returned, I'm already yawning.
Can you prescribe me a pick-me-up?

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.119
- Do your mining interests not invigorate?
- On the contrary.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.639
But perhaps your interest in Wheal Leisure
is not in actual mining?

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.919
- I hear you're now physician at Killewarren.
- Mr Penvenen keeps healthy. I rarely see him.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.639
Whereas I saw a good deal of his niece
in London.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.279
- I trust she was well.
- You've not heard from her?

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.359
- Nor did I expect to.
- Then her arrival here today, with Unwin,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.199
for their special announcement this evening
will not inconvenience you?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.839
Not in the least.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.679
Good day to you, sir.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.039
Why, Dr Enys.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.159
- How diverting.
- Miss Penvenen.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.759
- How is the scurvy in Sawle?
- Better, I thank you.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.159
The potato crop did not fail this year.
And there were apples.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.919
But no oranges?

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.919
Dear me, were there no other ladies
hereabouts to whom you might appeal

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.399
and tug on the heart strings,
in the name of charity?

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.879
I hope you're in good health, Miss Penvenen.
I...bid you good day.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.359
We meet after a year's absence
and you haven't a civil word for me?

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.279
I'm old-fashioned in these matters.
I thought civility should be shown on both sides.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.559
Would you excuse me?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.159
- Verity!
- My dears!

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.879
- How is she?
- All the better for seeing you.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.559
I can only stay a few days.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.799
It's good to have you home.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.359
(Inhales)

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.039
(Door opens and closes)

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.119
Ah...the prodigal returns.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.639
How was London?

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.159
Invigorating.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.079
And home to many fine banks.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.039
I wonder, is it not time
we had one of our own in Truro?

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.639
I have news...of an interesting document.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.839
Mm?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.079
A promissory note for £1 ,000
with interest at 40%.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.799
The lender believes it will never be repaid.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.839
- Ifwe offered to buy the debt...
- Why would we do that?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.239
Because the debtor would then be at our mercy.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.039
You seem lively tonight.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.639
Could it be that Jeremy's safe abed

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.119
and we're dining out at Killewarren
after a year ofturnips and tetty pie?

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.719
Take care you don't overdo the port
and trip over Caroline Penvenen's intended.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.799
Perhaps if I did, my husband
would pay me attention.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.359
Have I been so neglectful of late?

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.079
Ask your other wife. Grace.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.559
True, she is more taxing than you.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.159
But not as lovely.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.879
So tonight you'll have eyes for none but me?

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.559
Tonight I'll have eyes for none but you!

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.919
- New dress?
- If only.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.279
- You?
- How I wish.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.599
Shall we go in?

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.799
Do you not agree that since I've become an MP,
Cornwall's a better place?

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.919
In what regard?

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.119
Well, only today we've seen the arrest
of more smugglers.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.959
- For which you take credit?
- Mm.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.159
Since I've made it my mission to curb
lawlessness among the vulgars.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.159
Which reminds me. May I seek your advice

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.919
on the shameful lack of banking premises
in Truro?

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.439
Awkward?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.319
Not for me.
Last time we met, he went head over heels.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.879
I doubt he'll be keen to repeat the experience.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.079
RAY: Please be seated everyone.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.159
Thank you, sir.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.599
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.439
Must you sit here, Unwin? Have you not had
enough of my company in London?

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.959
I hope to have it officially after tonight.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.119
Captain Poldark, have you been in any scrapes
since I've been away?

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.519
I was most diverted
by your last court appearance.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.839
I try to avoid the place
whenever possible, ma'am.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.799
- By leading a virtuous life?
- I'm attempting to, ma'am.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.399
I fear the execution is often beyond me.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.039
ELIZABETH: She's very striking, isn't she?

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.639
Do you believe that what the eye does not
admire, the heart does not desire?

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.559
It's always been so with me.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.599
- As you should know.
- Should I?

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.239
We see little of each other now.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.279
I'm not sure I know you at all.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.999
Nor I, you.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.279
But that's hardly surprising.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.799
How much did we ever know of each other?

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.319
- Even before...
- Before you went away?

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.479
It seems like a lifetime ago.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.999
In some ways.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.959
- So you have returned, Captain.
- Aye...er...ma'am.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.479
I was plagued with a fever
and have come back to convalesce.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.959
Well, doubtless you'll enjoy
exploring the coves hereabouts.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.679
Looking for the smugglers, are you, sir?

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.879
But surely after your last visit,
you've quite put 'em down?

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.279
Aye, but they're damnably sly, ma'am.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.439
One can never be certain how they're disguised.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.639
I hope you do not suppose me to be such a one.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.039
(Laughs and slams table with hand)

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.999
It's only now that I realise how young you were
when you promised to marry me.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.759
I should have been old enough
to know my own mind.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.879
Let us agree that you were young.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.519
- And then you thought I was dead.
- Did I?

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.599
Or did I think I loved Francis better?

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.639
How soon I discovered my mistake.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.759
This is some pleasantjest, surely?

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.559
If it is, then it's against myself.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.559
Is it so astonishing that a woman who changed
her mind once would change it twice?

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.359
Cannot a woman love two men?

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.599
Cannot a man love two women?

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.399
I'm with Francis, and happy to be so.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.039
We're alike in many ways.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.279
But a piece of my heart will always be yours,

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.479
as a piece of yours will always be mine.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.919
UNWIN: Treat me
with deference when we are married.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.799
CAROLINE: Ifthat day ever comes.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.639
Then name it, Caroline, I beg you.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.159
I deplore beggars.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.439
How vexing you are!

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.159
Infuriating woman!

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.839
How is your friend Dr Enys?

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.119
Wedded to his work, ma'am,
with no time for distractions.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.719
Would you count me a "distraction"?

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.279
I shouldn't presume to connect you
with Dr Enys in any way.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.599
I'm sure he'll wish you well
on the occasion of your engagement.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.919
Aunt Agatha's very angry with me
for calling you.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.719
- What troubles her?
- A cough, a sore throat.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.479
And she tells me a fever,
but I can find no sign of it.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.079
I need no physician.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.279
Little Verity's perfectly capable oftending me.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.919
But when the time comes
for her to return home?

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.759
This is her home!

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.199
What is there to interest her elsewhere?

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.319
A husband?

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.359
Trenwith has never been the same
since she left.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.039
Can you diagnose the complaint?

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.719
I'll do my best.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.839
Are you married, sir?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.639
I'm not, ma'am.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.239
- My friends, my friends...
- (Music stops)

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.999
..I thank you, one and all,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.559
forjoining me
on this auspicious occasion.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.559
My dear niece, Caroline,

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.519
will soon no longer be under my charge.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.319
For in December, she comes of age.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.759
But before that,

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.679
I do believe I have to resign her
to the care of another.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.919
Unwin? Where is he?

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.679
Caroline?

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.359
I believe I saw him heading for his horse.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.639
Oh dear, I hope I haven't said anything
to upset him.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.639
Shall we have dancing?

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.959
(Crowd murmurs)

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.999
(Music resumes)

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.559
Can you tell what ails her?

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.719
I have my suspicions. I'll call again tomorrow.
In the meantime...

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.679
- What should I give her?
- Honey, juniper, a little warm milk...

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.519
..and your very best attention.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.999
Thank you.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.159
(Lively music plays)

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.119
There's a novelty. A married couple
who enjoy each other's company.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.799
But then, did they not marry for love?

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.319
- Allegedly.
- Dear me! How reckless.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.799
Francis, how good to see you.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.439
I regret I cannot return the compliment.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.599
This spite is pointless, Francis. From your
cousin, I've come to expect no reason...

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.079
Then expect none from me.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.239
Good evening, George.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.959
Ross...

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.839
I...had not expected to see you here.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.999
Ray Penvenen will insist on inviting the riff-raff.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.799
I hope your new mine prospers.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.679
It will.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.679
I wish I had your confidence.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.999
(Sighs) Must you be envious even ofthat?

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.559
(Slams door shut)

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.559
We will use whatever means necessary
to acquire that promissory note.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.439
DEMELZA: What Was Elizabeth saying to you?

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.319
ROSS: Nothing of importance.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.319
May I join you?

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.999
(Hissing and clanking)

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.759
The water levels have fallen at least a foot.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.119
By my calculation.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.399
- And you'll continue to monitor them?
- Surely.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.199
- So the engine appears to be working?
- It would appear so.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.799
What's our plan?

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.319
Continue to drain. Tomorrow we blast.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.719
- Then sift the ore, and ifwe're lucky...
- Copper!

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.999
- (Chuckles)
- The elusive Trevorgie lode!

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.039
Let's get started!

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.399
I don't mind sayin', when Mr Francis
first came aboard, I had my doubts,

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.959
but he's shown himself more'n equal to the task.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.879
- Your sort aren't welcome round here.
- What's that?

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.039
'Twill be ol' Nick Vigus.
Folk say he's the informer.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.759
MAN: backstabber round here!
- That wouldn't surprise me.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.719
- (Shouting continues)
- Backstabber, I say!

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.679
- Why do these men attack you, Nick?
- No idea, Cap'n.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.399
I ain't done nothin'.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.399
- Why would they think you had?
- Damned if I know.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.039
Damned you may be!

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.519
I suspect they attack you
for your habit ofturning against your fellows.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.919
I, sir?

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.919
You, sir.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.679
Letting Jim Carter take the blame
for your poaching escapade?

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.039
Pocketing George Warleggan's guineas
to testify against me in court?

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.479
I ain't the informer.
But since 'ee do accuse me, let me ask,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.359
why shouldn't a man sell himself
to the highest bidder?

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.719
Times like this, 'tis every man for himself.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.239
Betray us, you betray yourself.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.599
Fine words for gentlefolk to spout,

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.839
with no notion ofwhat it's like to live in squalor,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.639
even if 'ee think 'ee do
by slummin' with scullery maids!

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.439
Cap'n Ross! Cap'n Ross!

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.359
Let 'im be! Let 'im be.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.039
Have Dr Enys clean him up.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.359
What price would you be willing to pay
for that promissory note?

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.399
- Any.
- I thought so.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.239
What will you do with it?

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.319
That will depend.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.839
I cannot believe you would call.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.519
After my reception from Francis last night?

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.399
I don't expect you to be disloyal to Francis,

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.719
but don't you personally think this feud
has gone on long enough?

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.479
You know Francis when his mind is set.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.999
He holds you to blame
for the prosecution of Ross.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.239
Ross!

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.159
I wish I could enjoy the favour in your eyes
that he does.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.919
But let me be frank with you.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.639
Ross and I have never seen eye to eye.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.479
On my part, it's no more
than a clash of personality.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.279
On his, it's a disease.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.359
He plunges from one disaster to another
and blames me for all ofthem.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.999
- I hardly think that's fair...
- It comes of being born into money.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.159
But with it comes lack ofjudgment.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.479
His ill-conceived smelting venture
was doomed from the start.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.519
When he was out of pocket as a result,
he was too proud to ask friends for assistance

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:03.239
and instead signed a promissory note
for £1 ,000 at 40%  interest.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.999
When he ultimately beggars himself,
and Francis with him,

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.399
no doubt he'll accuse me of stealing the copper
from his ground overnight.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.279
May I ask...how you learned
ofthis promissory note?

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.319
It came into the hands of my Uncle Cary.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.679
And what does your uncle intend to do with it?

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.919
To let me deal with it.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.719
Perhaps you'd like me
to make a gift of it to Ross?

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.159
Would you?

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.759
If I thought he might drop his enmity.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.479
Do you ask it of me?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.799
What would you ask in return?

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.239
Merely to be admitted to your friendship again.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.879
I'll see what I can do.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.879
George Warleggan?

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.679
I remember the first time
Francis brought you here,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.199
fligged out in your frills and fallallery!

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.799
I remember it, too.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.479
Speak up, boy, I'm a little deaf.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.559
And still above ground.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.039
There should be a law to kill off old crones.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.039
Velvets and silks you wore.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.359
'Twas plain your mother had no taste.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.079
If you were the last ofthe Poldarks,
I'd do it myself.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.479
And you, staring about like a bull calf
that had strayed from its stall.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:32.479
But never fear, your great-nephews
are digging their own graves without my help.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.399
Goodbye, old woman.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.639
I hope when I next call, you'll be six feet below.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.679
I expect Jud'll be waitin' for the plantin' to be
finished afore he come sneakin' back?

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.519
Don't speak o' that lizard to me!

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.999
- Perhaps he's the informer.
- That braggashans?

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.559
- He's too loose-lipped to keep 'is trap shut.
- (Horse neighs and gallops)

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.919
While passing your husband's mine, I came
upon a man who was bruised and bleeding.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.199
His name was...Vigus.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.719
I know him. He works there on tribute.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.599
He tells me there's a deal of ill-feeling
about on account ofthe rumours.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.999
Rumours?

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.879
Of an informer.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.559
Ah, but you're so out ofthe way here,
perhaps the tales do not reach you.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.399
At any rate, the rumours make people tetchy.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.279
Whoever gave Vigus a beating
must have strong suspicions

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.359
as to his involvement in the trade.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.479
And were you able to discover who it was?

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.479
No, I was not minded to at this stage.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.399
I hope the assailant will realise his error
and not repeat it.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.199
One can only feel for the man's wife,
having such temper to contend with.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.239
Dr Enys! 'Ave 'ee 'eard o' Nick Vigus?

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.519
Captain Poldark did clout 'im,
yet he swears he's no traitor.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.319
Why would any suspect him?

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.559
We all suspect each other, sir.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.559
Do make the blood run cold
to think one of our own be false.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.879
- Dr Enys.
- Charlie!

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.959
Do 'ee tell Rosina how my health is mended
since I turn my hand to sail making?

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.639
I could provide handsome,
should I choose to wed again.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.319
- Do you have someone in mind?
- Maybe.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.719
Maybe I have someone in mind myself.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.759
Nay, don't 'ee flutter yer eyes at surgeon.
He's not for thee.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.159
Nor for any maid, sir. I'm wedded to my work.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.559
I thought I might find you here,
tending your beloved fisher folk!

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.719
If you'll excuse me, Miss Penvenen,
I've no time to...

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.479
Let me apologise.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.159
For my discourtesy, the other day.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.839
There. You weren't expecting that.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.879
Do you dislike me so very much?

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.919
Dislike?

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.119
If coming between me and my work every day
for the last 12 months,

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.039
if being unable to forget your voice

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.559
or the way you turn your head,
or the lights in your hair,

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.039
ifwanting to hear that you're married

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.039
and dreading to hear that you're married,
ifthat's dislike...

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.279
Perhaps you can identify
these symptoms for me?

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.639
Do you ride for pleasure?

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.679
I shall be in the woods by Killewarren
just afer eight tomorrow.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.559
DEMELZA: McNeil Was here.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.399
Encouraged by your smiles of last night,
no doubt?

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.759
Driven by the sight ofthe bruisin'
you gave Nick Vigus?

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.759
You think he comes here for me.
But what if he comes here for you?

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.119
- What if he knows something?
- Ofwhat?

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.879
Your dealings with Trencrom?

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.239
The more he comes calling...

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.639
The more likely he is to sniff something out.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.239
You cannot now offer discouragement
without arousing his suspicions.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.159
So I'm to blame?

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.399
You missed a treat.
George Warleggan graced us with his presence.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.279
- What did he want?
- To be reconciled with you.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.639
Is that why he called when my back was turned?

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.479
I know he's been vicious in his pursuit of Ross,

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.599
but I begin to think he would make amends
if he could.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.919
- How?
- By not taking advantage ofthe power he holds.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.679
You know he owns the ground we walk on.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.799
What harm can it do for you to modify
your hostility towards him?

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.079
If only to deter him
from wielding power over us all?

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.759
Perhaps I'll ride over and see him.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.399
Wished me dead, he did.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.199
Called me "old crone".

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.799
What's that, Aunt?

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.799
Big mistake.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.079
Francis.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.319
Elizabeth tells me you called today.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.959
I hope you took the visit
in the spirit in which it was intended.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.479
I believe I did.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.119
And I hope you will take what I have to say
in the same spirit.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.759
You will never again set foot in my house.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:51.599
Nor approach me, or my family,
including my son.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.799
He is no longer your godson.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.279
We are no longer your friends.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.679
You may turn us out of Trenwith if you wish.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.079
It will be a small price to pay to escape
the noxiousness of your acquaintance.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.239
- (Door slams shut)
- Call in his loans.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.679
Turn 'em out into the fields.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.039
I will not make Elizabeth suffer
for her husband's folly.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.999
And thanks to that promissory note,
I do not need to.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.999
- I cannot but admire Francis.
- What?

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.479
Well, he's not as handsome as some,
nor as daring...

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.919
..but he has a wisdom,
and he'd value his own skin.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.999
- He'll maybe live longer on that account.
- Do I not have wisdom?

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.799
Can you tell if a man
be a traitor to his friends or no?

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.919
Perhaps you should have married my cousin.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.919
He's a good man.
He has things that you lack.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.039
Though you have things that he lacks.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.279
Put the two ofyou together
and that would make a complete man.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.479
Do I leave such a lot to be desired?

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.279
Yes, Ross. A lot to be desired.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.439
(Whispers) Ssssh! Don't wake Mama.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:53.639
Papa has to be off early
to the mine to start the blasting.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.959
I'll be home in time to read you a story.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.359
(Mine pump pounding)

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.199
I've told Henshawe I'll set the fuses myself.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.439
Shall we go below?

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.159
By all means.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.759
I have a feeling our fortunes will change today.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.919
They'll need to,
after what I said to George last night.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.159
- You're in haste.
- I have a rendezvous.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.999
With Caroline?

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.439
Don't excite yourself. It'll come to nothing!
We could not be less suited.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.999
- She is an heiress and I am...
- As lowly as a kitchen maid?

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.839
May not a woman confer status
as well as a man? Ross raised me up.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.599
And Ross knows he was entirely the winner
in that transaction.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.999
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.239
- Yah!
- (Horse gallops away)

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.119
Here's to copper, gentlemen.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.039
(Small explosion and fizzing)

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.759
(Muffled explosion)

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.039
- Anything?
- What do you make ofthis?

00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:01.279
Let's collect some more samples,
bring 'em above and examine them fully.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.839
Mistress Poldark above for 'ee, Cap'n.
She say it's urgent.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.599
You go, Ross. I'll stay here.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.519
This came for you.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.999
It's from Pascoe.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.879
I'm wanted in Truro.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.599
- Is it bad news?
- I'll know more when I see him.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.959
I have no idea why I'm here.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.719
Well, then you'll be glad to hear
that I'm leaving today.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.399
Uncle Ray is angry with me.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.159
I suspect he wants me safely locked away
until my marriage.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.719
Which is...to be when?

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.719
Who knows?

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.679
At any rate, not Unwin. He jilted me.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.279
Or was it the other way round?

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.839
Tell me, who is Dwight Enys?

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.159
Is he the strong, capable man
that bestrides the sick room

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.719
or the hesitant one I see here today?

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.599
A man with not the smallest fortune.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.879
Money was never plentiful
and studying took all I had.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.079
I hardly ever met women, except as cases.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:45.359
So if you come to me with a sore throat,
I know what to do.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.519
If I meet you in a drawing room,

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:53.199
you are a creature whose moods and manners
I've never learnt to decipher.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:58.399
And if you laugh at me, which you frequently do,
I become tongue-tied and foolish.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.079
Poor Dwight.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.319
Do I show such confidence and poise?

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.919
How well I've been schooled.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.679
While you were learning to be a physician,
I was learning to be an heiress.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.919
An heiress must learn how to walk,

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.679
to dress, to ride, to dance...

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.479
You say you don't know women
except as patients.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.039
I don't know men at all.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.399
What would you like to know?

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.919
And now...no doubt you hate me.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.679
And now, no doubt I hate you.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.679
I must go.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.999
Until December.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.119
But nothing will change.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.279
One thing will change.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.799
In December, I come of age.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.879
Did Francis make his peace with George
last night?

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.159
Not as far as I know.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.079
When can I go down the mine, Mama?

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.799
- When copper is found?
- Will it be?

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.439
I've never seen Francis
more convinced of anything.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.959
Or more determined to be the one to find it?

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:01.719
He's been so long in Ross's shadow.
I think he wants to earn his admiration.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.479
And yours?

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.599
Since it's to be your last night with us,
I've asked Mrs Tabb for a special dessert.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.519
(Mine pump pounding)

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.719
Have you seen Captain Henshawe
or Zacky Martin?

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.559
- Jus' missed 'em, sir. Can I be of service?
- Damn.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.679
Erm...no, no matter. I'll ride to Nampara.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.079
Thank you.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.639
Francis.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.039
Ross has not yet returned from Truro.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.919
'Tis never copper?

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.639
I hardly dare hope but...

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.199
..yes, yes, I think it may be.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.359
(Exclaims)

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.999
(Both laugh)

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.039
I must get back to the mine. Will you have Ross
take a look when he returns?

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.199
Will... Will you not stay and ask him yourself?
He'll be that relieved.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.799
It's my dearest wish to be of use to him...

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.639
..to make amends.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.279
You do not ask me
what amends I need to make.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.959
I'm not sure I wish to know.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.119
- Yet I think I must tell you.
- Francis, there's no need.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.079
Years ago, when the Carnmore Copper
Company fought for its life,

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.519
George came to me one evening.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.479
Verity had left and I blamed you
for her marriage.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:03.199
And in my rage I gave George the names
ofthe Carnmore shareholders.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.679
I suspect Ross, and you,
already have some inkling but...

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.519
..I've never had the courage
to come and tell you outright.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.399
But you can't rebuild a friendship
by ignoring what destroyed it, so...

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.239
..so now you know.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.399
- I'll go now.
- Wait, Francis.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.639
Ifwe break now,
we'll only hurt each other all the more.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.439
One bad thing does not outweigh
the many good.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.679
'Tis the balance that counts.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.279
You believe that?

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.679
(Exhales)
I don't wonder Ross loves you.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.359
Do you suppose he still does?

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.279
You doubt it?

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.479
Sometimes I think he loves Elizabeth better.

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:20.199
May I tell you something, Demelza?

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.679
You have one failing.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.239
And that is that you don't think well enough
of yourself.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.959
You came here as a miner's daughter

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:38.599
and married into this ancient family.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.039
And you took its standards as your own.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.599
So you mistake your own value.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.479
Ross was a wise man when he chose you.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.679
He will not forget it.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:58.639
But Elizabeth is...so lovely, well bred.

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.199
And she's Ross's first love.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.199
How can I compete with perfection?

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.599
You must do away with the notion
that someone has done you a favour

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.679
by letting you into this family.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.799
Will you do that?

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.519
I'll try.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.919
George Warleggan has my promissory note?

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.919
Alas so.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.799
I'd not expect much sympathy
for any request to extend the loan period.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.159
- Night, sur.
- Good night, sur.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.479
(Rumbling and pounding of pump)

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.119
- Is it serious?
- Yes. And physic will not cure it.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.679
- What will?
- Your presence here is what she craves.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.279
- And you have a life elsewhere.
- So what's to be done?

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.999
In matters ofthe heart,
I think you must be the physician, ma'am.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.159
Thank you.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.879
I must leave you tomorrow, Aunt.

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.639
I have a husband and a home to return to.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.639
But they don't need you
as Trenwith needs you.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.039
'Tis not as if you have children.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.159
And the cards.
Today they threaten some impending ill.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.439
Which perhaps only you can prevent?

00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.519
(Coughs and sniffs)

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.319
(Gasps)

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.959
- (Rock collapses)
- Aagh!

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.679
(Gasps and splutters)

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.479
Help me!

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.639
(Grunts)

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.439
Is there anybody there?

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.279
Help me!

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.199
Help!

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.679
Will Francis be dining with us?

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.799
I've sent to Nampara for him.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.559
(Door closes)

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.679
(Footsteps approach)

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.159
My debt is in the hands ofthe Warleggans.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.359
- By Christmas I must find £1 ,400.
- Or else?

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.279
We lose everything we own
and I go to debtors' prison.

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.839
(Footsteps approach)

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.639
Someone come from Trenwith
lookin' for Mr Francis.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.679
Is he not at the mine?

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.159
At this hour?

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.199
Help!

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.519
Somebody!

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.239
(Grunts)

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.439
(Gasps)

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.279
(Groans and winces)

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.239
HENSHAWE:
I came as quickly as I could.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.439
Is it Mr Francis?

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:41.119
I think he may still be down below.
No one's seen him for hours.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.479
Demelza, wait here.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.759
(Coughs and groans)

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.879
Some ofthe men saw him
heading for the 30 level.

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.959
Then we start there and work our way through.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.999
Francis?

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.039
(Verity reads quietly)

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.199
(Reads aloud)

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.359
(Clock ticks)

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.599
Thank you, Prudie.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:48.999
Captain Henshawe sent for me.
Is it an accident?

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.839
Francis is missing.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.799
(Laboured breathing)

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.199
(Echoing laughter and waves breaking)

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.759
(Children's laughter echoes)

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:12.079
Francis?

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.279
- Let's try the lower levels.
- Go easy.

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.399
There's still a lot ofwater down there.

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.119
(Clock ticks)

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:49.199
(Echoing laughter)

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.999
Ross! Help me!

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.239
(Weakly) Ross.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.839
ROSS: (Distant) Francis!

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.879
Francis!

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.199
Francis, are you there?

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.439
- Ross?
- Francis?

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.359
Ross.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.279
- Give me your hand.
- I knew you'd come!

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.599
(Water whooshes)

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.559
(Muffled water whooshing)

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.479
(Whispers) Ross...

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.879
(Water bubbling echoes)

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.519
Mr Francis!

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:08.999
Francis!

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:22.359
Francis...

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.679
(Sobs)

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.559
Francis...

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.719
Why the hell didn't you learn to swim?

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.439
(Horse approaches)

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.039
That's your father's horse.
I'll see if supper's ready.

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.599
I'll go.

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.079
(Pounding on door)

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.119
(Violin plays)
