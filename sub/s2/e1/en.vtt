WEBVTT

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.999
(Gulls cry)

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.159
Mr Poldark...

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.599
it is alleged
that you roused the neighbourhood...

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.559
and led a bloodthirsty mob
down to the beach.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.999
- Incorrect.
- Which part?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.039
They Were not thirsty for blood.
They were starving for food.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.839
Did you encourage the riot
Which broke out on the beach?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.279
I did not consider it a riot.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.319
Do you approve of plunder
and lawlessness?

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.639
Do you approve of families being
Without sufficient food to keep them alive?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.799
What part did you play
in the death of MattheW Sanson?

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.319
Regrettably, none Whatsoever.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.839
(Sighs) Enough of this insolence.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.759
Ross Vennor Poldark,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.799
I am committing you for trial
at the Bodmin assizes.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.079
Bail Will be set at £1 00.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.999
And may God have mercy upon you,
for I, most assuredly, Would not.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.759
(Wind Whistles)

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.839
Julia...

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.959
(Door opens)

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.119
Ross!

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.839
They let you go. I kneW they Would.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.399
Did they dismiss all the charges?

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.239
Not quite.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.839
I'm to be tried by Justice Lister
at the Bodmin assizes in five days' time.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.119
I must present myself at the gaol
the night before.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.239
Oh, God... how has it come to this?

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.639
George?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.959
This entire thing is a nonsense.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.279
I'll be back before you know I've gone.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.319
he should never have been charged.
He's a gentleman, and a Poldark.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.999
his own worst enemy.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.119
I would speak to him, but he avoids me.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.399
he avoids us all. Since they lost Julia.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.799
Well, something must be done
or he will walk his head into a noose.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.039
Or that new contraption they have in France.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.919
If he's a sensible man, he will...
seek assistance.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.559
have words in the ears of those that matter.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.199
- The Boscowans?
- St Aubyns.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.199
- Warleggans?
- (Scoffss)

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.279
When their cousin died in the wreck? No.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.999
George is...
very likely behind the accusations.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.639
But he could exert influence if he chose.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.119
Mm. his reach...extends everywhere.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.399
Why would George
throw his might behind Ross?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.719
You're right. Why would he?

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.679
(Gulls cry)

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.119
- There's a storm coming.
- (Thunder rumbles)

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.279
Julia's afeared of thunder.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.719
I keep thinking that she's still here.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.919
And if I just call her name...

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.799
I'll be better, by and by.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.319
I tell myself that every day. And every day I fail.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.159
We must think of the trial.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.759
- (Groans) Must we?
- Ross, 'tis no little thing.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.519
It's a proper trial, not just a magistrate.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.319
You must answer to judge and jury,
and if you're found guilty...

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.359
They cannot hang me.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.479
- I've too much to do.
- Truly, Ross...

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.879
Truly, Demelza, I decline to be distracted
by matters beyond my control.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.359
Give me leave to attend
on something I can influence.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.759
(Low chatter)

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.719
Gentlemen! I leave for Bodmin in two days.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.279
What are we waiting for?

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.759
No doubt ye aim to strike
a new lode before 'ee go.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.239
A couple at least, so let's get down there.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.719
New lode? he'll be lucky.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.759
The old Trebartha lode's near petered out,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.439
- but he won't have it.
- No more than he'll have this trial.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.079
To hear him you'd think
he was heading for Michaelmas Fair.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.679
Dwight.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.719
he cannot just bury his head.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.919
Then will you tell him? It's almost upon him.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.359
how will he defend himself?
Who will speak for him?

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.159
I will. But there must be others,
and plenty of them.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.519
The Crown
will already have assembled its case.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.599
And no doubt there'll be plenty
who'll be glad to help it.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.679
- Can I rely on you, Tankard?
- Of course.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.359
Always happy to be of service.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.599
Why is our attorney here?

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.599
he's been assisting the Crown
to strengthen its case.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.039
Mm. Theft, riot,
attacking a customs officer.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.719
- Is that not enough?
- I wanted murder.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.119
I told you that charge would not stick.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.959
Cousin Matthew was dead
before he washed ashore.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.959
- Poldark merely found him.
- And left him lifeless on the strand.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.279
- Which is not a crime.
- But it is a personal affront to this family.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.399
And one which I intend to make him regret.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.919
Prudence Paynter! My name's Tankard.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.399
Acting for the Crown
in the case of Rex versus Poldark.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.239
What do you recall the night of the shipwreck?

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.279
- Shipwreck?
- See thee now, woman.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.199
When there's riot and robbery
like there was on that night...

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.159
The law says naught of those who follow
if it can lay hold of those who lead.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.639
So, 'tis best for all concerned
that the right man should stand in the assizes.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.279
The right man? Ross Poldark?

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.679
I never see'd sight nor sound of him.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.639
Elizabeth. Are you alone?

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.559
I was about to return to Trenwith.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.039
Would you consider a small delay?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.479
(Chatter)

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.479
GEORGE: Are you suggesting I intervene?
- The family would be so grateful.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.239
The family means little to me.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.319
You alone are the person I care to please.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.639
It distresses me to think
of my cousin at risk of his life.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.479
It is I who would be indebted to you, George.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.679
how difficult would it be to have him
come before a sympathetic judge?

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.919
There are ways of encouraging such sympathy.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.239
But does Ross ask it of me?

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.159
You know, you and Ross
are more alike than you know.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.439
I have said so. I said it to him.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.159
I do not think he could fail to feel gratitude.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.279
If he felt himself beholden,

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.639
if...if he could see his benefactor
in a new light.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.839
So, you've made no arrangements?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.079
- None whatsoever.
- Jeffrey Clymer, KC.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.199
Your defence. he'll meet you in Bodmin.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.919
Will he?

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.559
Next, your finances.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.519
You are chief shareholder in Wheal Leisure.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.279
Other than that, you have no income.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.239
Your tenants regularly default on their rents,
your house is mortgaged

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.319
and you have outstanding debts
of £1 ,000 at interest of 40% .

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.479
My wife will be sorry she wed me.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.559
Your wife deserves better.
Have you made a will?

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.639
Course not.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.599
- I need a list of all your assets.
- That shouldn't take long.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.599
ELIZABETH: My dear Demelza.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.359
I know that recent events
have caused a breach between our two families,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.799
but wonder if I could persuade
you and Ross to visit us

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.799
at Trenwith tomorrow afternoon?

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.079
(Geese honking, traders calling out)

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.079
- Ah, Captain Poldark!
- Mr Trevaunance.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.119
How goes your campaign?

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.599
Better than yours, I imagine.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.399
- Who was that?
- No-one of any influence.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.879
Jud Paynter?

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.399
Never heard of him.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.119
You were on Hendrawna Beach
the night of the shipwreck.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.959
- Was I?
- Perhaps...

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.639
- this will jog your memory.
- Ah, well, now...

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.879
Get off home,
you bladderwrackin', pifflin' piece of offal!

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.159
- Uncle Ray.
- Caroline!

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.719
My dear! And Mr Trevaunance,
our prospective member of Parliament.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.799
I see you travel light, niece.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.279
How long are you intending to stay?

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.439
That depends. If my little Horace and I get bored
we may be forced to return to London.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.879
No doubt you're much in demand there.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.399
An heiress is much in demand everywhere,
especially one who's not yet of age.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.639
Why so?

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.599
It's assumed she'll do the bidding of her
wealthy uncle and marry where he chooses.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.519
(Chuckles) You confident, Unwin?

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.079
Winning his seat or my hand?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.759
Both, I trust.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.639
I hope we can come to terms soon, sir.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.679
I hope so, too.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.919
She runs rings round her old guardian.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.359
I'm sure a younger man
would benefit from the exercise.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.559
Did I mention I saw Unwin Trevaunance,
our would-be MP,

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.199
and his intended, Ray Penvenen's niece?

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.919
No doubt she's in town
for the election in Bodmin.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.839
Never been to Bodmin.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.879
Be grateful you're not going now.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.919
Why?

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.879
The elections take place
the same day as the assizes.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.039
The town will be seething.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.439
Will Elizabeth go?

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.479
I shouldn't think so.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.879
She sent us a note.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.119
What could she want?

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.279
The same as I.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.519
You did promise me after Julia died
that we would all be reconciled.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.119
You still want that?

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.319
With the trial nigh upon us...

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.119
..maybe I'll be glad of the friendship.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.279
Even though the cost is Julia?

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.719
Nay, Ross, you cannot lay it all at their door.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.759
Why can I not?

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.439
'Tis why I do wish to make peace...

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.759
..despite all that we lost.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.479
Will it not mean that Julia didn't die in vain?

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.479
It's good of you both to come.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.119
- Is Francis here?
- Somewhere hereabouts.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.279
I wanted to speak with you first.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.039
To ask if some help might be given
when you come to court.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.839
I hope you will take the gesture
with the kindness in which it's intended.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.159
(Footsteps)

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.319
"Gesture"?

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.879
George might know the judge
who will hear your case.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.159
How convenient.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.759
And thought that perhaps he could be...

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.639
Pointed in the right direction.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.639
For a price, no doubt.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.839
Not one that you would personally need to pay.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.919
But I see that I would.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.799
(Door opens)

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.519
And it strikes me
as more than my liberty's worth.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.599
- (Door closes)
- Demelza, we're leaving.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.079
Ross...

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.799
Elizabeth, what's the meaning of this?

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.719
I...I thought if there was something
we could do to help Ross...

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.079
- "We"?
- We appreciate the thought.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.719
But not the method.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.719
Ross...

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.919
You'll excuse us, George.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.039
O course.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.879
I thought it the least we could do.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.959
- For Demelza's sake.
- Demelza's?

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.319
Of course.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.839
Do they seriously imagine
I would stoop to beg favours

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.999
from that upstart poodle?

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.919
If I wished to prostitute myself,
I'd sooner grovel to Ray Penvenen

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.359
who's actually acquainted
with Judge Lister.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.959
- Is he?
- It really is the end for me and Francis.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.839
- Where are you going?
- To the mine.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.079
Where it's still possible
to do an honest day's work.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.759
"A known Jacobin and revolutionary,
formentor of unrest and affray.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.759
Once escaped justice
by taking the King's shilling,

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.239
fathered numerous bastards,
bedded and wedded his scullery maid

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.639
upon whom he got his latest brat,
this creature being a notorious doxy

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.559
from a family of murderers and thieves."

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.519
Our friend "Anonymous"
has an engaging style.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.319
How many copies?

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.679
Enough to paper all Truro and Bodmin.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.239
If he's found guilty, he could hang.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.439
If he hangs, he'll have only himselfto blame.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.039
Mistress Poldark to see Mister Penvenen.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.959
Mrs Poldark?

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.159
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.519
Forgive the intrusion, sir.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.719
I was taken queasy as I was out walking and...

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.839
well, yours was the first house I saw.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.519
Ah.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.199
(Grunting)

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.999
'Tis no use, Ross.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.959
The lode has petered out.
We knew it a week ago.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.359
- So we give up?
- We move on.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.679
FRANCIS: There sits our old mine.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.999
Lost in a game of cards to a Warleggan.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.679
Ross would never gamble away
his...most precious asset, would he?

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.839
He is too wise and clever.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.199
Francis, what is done is done.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.759
DEMELZA: Thank you forthe refreshment, sir.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.999
I hope that you are not too downcast
about your husband's coming trial.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.919
(Sighs) Truly...I fear the worst.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.199
If only one knew
who the judge would be.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.759
Oh, that's no secret, ma'am.
Tis Justice Wentworth Lister.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.759
Oh. Are you acquainted with him?

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.639
Oh, we know each other.
He'll be supporting Unwin Trevaunance

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.239
at the election tomorrow night.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.359
A stern fellow, though generally accounted fair.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.919
(Sighs) It do puzzle me exceedingly
how a judge can be expected to listen to a case

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.519
and get to the bottom of it all in a few hours.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.479
Does he never ask for the truth in private
before the trial begins?

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.639
(Chuckles) Perhaps he should!

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.399
- Will you be in Bodmin for the assizes?
- For the election, yes.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.119
Well, I hope we may meet again, sir.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.559
- Who is that, Uncle?
- Hm? Ross Poldark's wife.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.519
- What does she want?
- She didn't appear to want anything.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.519
Well, I doubt that, sir.
She looks like a dangerous woman to me.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.479
Ross.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.159
Well, this is well met.
May I walk with you awhile?

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.839
- I'm pressed for time.
- The encounter yesterday,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.879
that was not my doing.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.119
Still, I'd hoped we could put
past quarrels behind us.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.559
I had hoped so, too.
But I find now I cannot.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.599
Ross...

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.999
if something goes amiss in court,
how is Demelza fixed?

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.079
How is that your concern?

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.279
If your sentence is prison...or worse, erm...

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.079
..well, she would be entirely alone
with no source of income.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.079
Whereas you yourself
are swimming in guineas?

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.999
No, no. I've erm...I've a little put by.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.839
Why would you offer it?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.119
I don't forget what we owe Demelza.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.159
(Knock on door)

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.319
Mr Warleggan, ma'am.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.239
Elizabeth. You look ravishing today.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.399
- And you, too, of course, ma'am.
- I do not.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.719
And nor, may I say, do you.
Quite pasty-faced.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.479
Consequence of sitting
too long indoors fingering coin.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.079
(Clears throat)
I've brought a small gift for my godson.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.799
Oh. That's kind of you, George.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.839
Papa!

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.999
Look, my very own horse.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.999
Uncle George bought it for me.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.159
Did he?

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.839
(Door opens)

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.679
George, here again.
I hope you're taking care of our guest, Elizabeth.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.279
(Glass clinks, drink poured)

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.719
I saw my cousin just now.
He was not eager to exchange pleasantries.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.559
No doubt he's thinking ofthe trial.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.159
Do you think he'll be acquitted?

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.919
I don't see how he can be.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.159
So many witnesses to his activities that night.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.999
(Scoffs)

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.839
And the fact that he's treated the law
with contempt on previous occasions.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.999
And the court will not be left in ignorance.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.879
As I came past Sawle,
a villager showed me this pretty paper.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.879
"The true and sensational life of Captain R P.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.999
Adventurer, seducer, wrecker
and suspected murderer."

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.559
Yes, I've seen them about.
They're not important.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.959
- Except to Ross.
- But ifthis is believed,

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.479
- it will prejudice the jury.
- Pay no heed, Elizabeth.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.719
These scurrilous sheets are always defaming
one person or another.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.159
Yes, but this author has gone
to some trouble and expense.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.719
You wouldn't happen to know him...
would you, George?

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.879
I imagine he must be desperate
to earn his money in such a manner.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.879
Only a bankrupt would sell his services that way.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.559
(Drunkenly) ♪ They had no tail nor bill

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.199
♪ They had no tail nor...bill

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.839
Jud Paynter.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.479
'Tis said that you and your good wife
were once servants of Captain Poldark?

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.239
And his father afore him.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.839
And that after serving faithfully
for all those years

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.919
- you were turned out without a word.
- Monstry ingratitude!

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.879
So you understand your duty under the law

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.239
is to report what you saw
the night ofthe wreck?

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.919
We know you took part
in the riot and pillaging.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.759
We know you played a part
in resisting officers ofthe Crown.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.239
I never 'eard such...

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.719
But we're willing to overlook all that
if you will turn King's evidence.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.199
You owe him no loyalty.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.479
It's common sense to testify against him.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.679
We'll make it worth your while.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.599
I have no idea what to say in your defence
and you leave for Bodmin tomorrow.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.519
I was not on the beach,
so I cannot refute the charges

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.879
but from what I hear,
they are not easily dismissed.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.839
Salvaging spoils from a wreck?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.999
No jury in Cornwall will convict me ofthat.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.359
- Attacking a customs official?
- Not guilty.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.919
You doubt me.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.079
We both know you're capable of it.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:24.559
- Your situation is not good, Ross.
- I've seen worse. We've seen worse.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.959
- On the battlefields of Virginia.
- And I salute you for saving my face.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.119
Saving your neck may not be so easy.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.839
I'll ask Demelza
not to come to Bodmin tomorrow.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.999
So you and I will ride together?

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.959
Perhaps as we go
some brilliant defence will occur to me.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.559
(Horse galloping)

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.679
(Music plays from inside)

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.159
Who's this fine lady?

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.639
- And what has she done with my wife?
- Judas!

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.679
(Laughs) Well, there she is.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.719
For a moment, I thought I'd lost her.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.359
Why? Cos she's prinked up to the nines
and her fizzog's powdered?

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.879
Clearly I needn't worry about you
when I'm gone.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.199
You'll have a line of suitors
from here to Penzance.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.199
So I should hope.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.839
(Knock at door)

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.159
May I join you awhile?

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.439
Perhaps another night.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.279
Good night, Francis.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.679
Good night.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.199
(Wood chopping continues outside)

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.319
So you leave me a-bed
like the Queen of Sheba

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.759
while you see to all the chores?

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.639
Is it not my duty to cherish my wife
while I'm here?

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.999
And to provide firewood for when I'm not?

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.279
I wish we could stay like this forever.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.519
I wish so, too.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.719
I'm only glad for your sake
you're not seeing me in court.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.879
No, Ross.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.039
You will stay here?

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.399
Yes, Ross, ifthat's what you wish.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.199
Elizabeth? I'm leaving for Bodmin.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.799
Shall I not come with you?

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.199
A court is no place for a lady.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.119
It's a terrible thought, is it not?

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.399
A world without Ross.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.199
I wonder how Demelza would bear it.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.199
How would any of us bear it?

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.439
Which of us does not secretly adore him?

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.799
How different might our lives have been...

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.119
Had Ross not returned from the war?

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.359
Had he never gone away in the first place.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.039
Goodbye, my dear. God bless you.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.199
Francis!

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.439
- No.
- Hey...

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.639
You'll come home again?

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.319
I promise.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.919
Ross!

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.999
PENVENEN: You spoilhim.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.999
How else could I persuade him
to come to Bodmin with me?

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.559
Indeed, he wonders why
either of us must go at all.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.759
You tell him it is because
tonight is election night

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.999
and as Unwin's intended,
you are expected to be at his side.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.839
Horace and I will spend an agreeable evening
in our lodgings eating jellies.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.119
- Caroline...
- What?

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.959
You'd prefer I caught a cold in
some draughty assembly rooms

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.999
watching dreary men voting?

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.759
I may venture out later,
if Horace can spare me.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.479
Bodmin, Horace.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.879
I bet nothing of moment ever happens there.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.279
(Town crier calling out)

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.479
Your room, sir.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.959
Beg pardon, sir,
be you a surgeon or such like?

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.159
I am.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.599
There's someone took mortal sick
at Priory House.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.759
I'll go at once.

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.039
(Approaching horses and carriage)

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.519
Verity!

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.559
I've saved you a place, my dear.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.719
Thank you.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.719
(Driver commands horses)

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.599
- You did tell Ross you're coming?
- Of course not.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.199
(Laughter and chatter)

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.039
Jeffrey Clymer, King's Counsel.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.519
I'm here to see
ifwe can wriggle you offthe hook.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:08.399
"Theft, inciting a riot,
attacking a customs officer."

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.199
Impressive.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.599
I'm a physician, ma'am. May I be of service?

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.639
I hope so. My darling little Horace has had
two fits and now he's barely breathing.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.919
- Will you attend on him, please?
- (Whining)

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.119
Your dog?

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.119
Your footman made a mistake.
It would be a farrier you sent him for.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.719
It's not my custom to employ
a horse doctor for Horace.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.999
I want the best advice
and I'm willing to pay for it.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.439
- What is your fee?
- (Sighs)

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.799
But perhaps you do not know
your trade well enough.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.199
Perhaps you should leave.
We'll call someone else.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.599
That was what I was about to suggest.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.279
Wait.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.119
Have you never had a dog of your own?

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.279
Yes.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.679
Would you let him die
on a point offormality?

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.559
- How old is he?
- 12 months.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.599
Fits are not uncommon at that age.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.759
An aunt of mine had a spaniel.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.599
His pulse is steady
and there's no sign offever.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.879
Nevertheless,
I'd advise a lowering system oftreatment.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.439
No more sweetmeats,
plenty of running and jumping.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.599
Dogs do not need to be carried.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:48.919
Have a druggist make up this paregoric
of black cherry water and Theban opium.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.679
Thank you.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.639
You were saying?
About your aunt's spaniel.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.319
Oh. Er...yes. He used to have fits,
when she played the spinet.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.119
One hesitates to say whether
he was musical or the reverse.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.999
What is your name?

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.639
Following to your arrest,

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.719
your statement to the examining magistrate
was unhelpful.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.159
I answered truthfully.
Is that not what the law requires?

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.719
A common misconception is the truth
is the same as innocence. It is not.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.479
Myjob is to position the truth
so that you don't pay for it with your life.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.519
I see.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.879
So now we're politicians.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.079
Positioning the facts
to suit our own ends.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.039
And the people on the beach that day?

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.239
Shall we pretend
that they were not desperate?

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.039
Should we explain that starvation
and poverty are also relative?

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:50.399
Let me be clear. Anything other than
absolute contrition would be sheer folly.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.399
So my task is to grovel?

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.159
Play the game by bending the rules.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.319
Excellent.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.319
(Bell clanging, shouting)

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.159
Thank you.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.239
Oh, this town's a-boiling.
I forgot it was election week.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.439
Yes, I lately met one ofthe candidates.
A friend of our neighbour Penvenen.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.199
Indeed, later I must go out on an errand.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.839
- With the streets full of drunkards?
- 'Tis for Ross I must do it.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.119
(Hubbub)

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.199
- When are the votes to be counted?
- Not until this evening, sir.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.999
Have you seen this?

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.039
There's been an assassination
of Ross Poldark's character.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.039
How unfortunate.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.959
- Not a single room?
- I'm sorry, sir, we're full.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.199
- In the entire inn?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.199
(Scoffs)

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.359
Enys. Are you here for the trial?

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.799
- I am indeed. And you?
- Yes, I thought to look in.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.879
Look, erm... do you know where
I can find a room for the night?

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.439
This place is full
and the town is fermenting with people.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.039
You may be unlucky.
I trust your sister had the foresight

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.399
- to reserve her room at The Crown?
- Verity's here?

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.759
I saw her go in just now, with Demelza.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.119
Is your wife with you?

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.279
Erm...Elizabeth prefers
to remain at Trenwith.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.719
If erm...ifyou should be
without a place to sleep tonight,

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.759
I'm at the London Inn,
beside the church.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.919
You may be held to that.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.719
Terrible thing!

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.599
A man of his standing,
and that young wife of his.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.039
Francis, are you joining us?

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.879
Will I not be interrupting
your council ofwar?

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.079
- Against whom?
- My cousin.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.839
As declared in your recent literary effort.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.919
Excuse me.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.959
It is a piece offiction
entirely worthy of you!

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.999
Tell me...

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:17.879
what could induce you to throw your weight
behind Ross instead of against him?

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.119
The very same question
your wife asked me.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.599
Naturally, I could not now consider it.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.439
Ross has offered me insolence
once too ofen.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.599
In that case, may I offer you some advice?

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.759
- By all means.
- You may flaunt your guineas

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.319
on lavish garments and fancy carriages.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:41.079
You may purchase a coat of arms
and deck out your servants in gaudy livery.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:46.239
You may even buy your way into every club,
mine and drawing room in the county,

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.239
but what you will never buy...

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.759
..is nobility.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.999
Or breeding. Or even common decency.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.239
Are you quite sure you don't wish to apologise,
Francis?

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.359
Given the nature of our association?

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.799
Oh, you own me, I acknowledge that.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.359
And my indebtedness to you
has long muddied the waters between us,

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:18.159
so I trust that any confusion...about my
feelings...

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.639
..is now entirely cleared up.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.999
I'll visit you in gaol with a list ofwitnesses
who are to appear against you.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.159
And those for me?

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.399
A shorter list.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:07.119
Friends' and workers' testimony,
presumed biased, will be easily dismissed.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.319
Meanwhile, I advise you
to reconsider your attitude.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.519
It's no detriment to me
if you choose to run your neck into a noose.

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.199
But I suspect it might be to yours.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.119
Mr Warleggan.
I see Unwin speaks the truth.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.999
He cannot stir an inch without you.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.759
- He says the same of you.
- Of course.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.279
We're both indispensable
to his ascent in the world.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.559
- I, as a hunting trophy...
- Caroline...

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:46.799
And you as...how to describe you?

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.839
Benefactor? Sponsor? Paymaster?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.839
I am certainly lending my support
to his campaign.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.039
- Shall we go out and wave to the crowd?
- And I am lending mine to his arm.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.639
I wonder which one of us
stands to gain the most.

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.919
(Cell door clangs, keys jangle)

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.159
Are you sure Ross meant you to go out alone?

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.279
You're a lady, after all.

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.519
I was brought up a miner's daughter.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.759
There's naught a few drunkards could do
that I couldn't give 'em back.

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.159
(Chatter)

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.799
"I am a voice crying in the wilderness!
Make ye ready the ways ofthe Lord.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.079
For the kingdom of God is at hand!"

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.239
Father?

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.439
So. Now 'ee be cast into the pit, daughter?

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.639
Thy child is buried,
thy husband's to hang.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.839
See now the wages of sin?

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.079
- I know of no sin.
- Turn again now, daughter.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.799
- Come home and live a pure life.
- Thank you, Father.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.479
I appreciate the offer, but...
I hope it will not be needed.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.999
"'Vengeance is mine' sayeth the Lord.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.679
'For the day of calamity is at hand."'

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.319
(Knock at door)

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.239
What have you forgot, Demelza?

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.959
- Oh.
- Have you brandy?

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.079
- Or rum?
- There's port.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.199
Demelza's tipple.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.359
(Glass clinks, drink poured)

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.319
Well, sister...

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.799
(Sighs)

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.399
How's it feel to be married
to a drunken brute?

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.239
Francis, I hoped...

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.399
What, that I'd come to make peace?

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.079
With my sister, perhaps.
But not with a Mistress Blamey.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.119
We're happy, Francis.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.599
And I hope the day will come
when you'll be glad for me.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.119
- And allow me home to Trenwith.
- As soon as you like.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.159
As soon as you like.

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.319
Without him.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.719
Oh, do I disappoint you?
Well, I disappoint most people.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.919
Father. Elizabeth. Myself.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.199
Why is it that I amount
to precisely nothing?

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.919
Whereas Ross...
Ross is considered such a threat

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.679
that men will spend a fortune
in order to get him hanged!

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.159
- And yet I envy him.
- You cannot.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.359
If I were going to meet myjudges...

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.639
..I would give them a piece of my mind.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.039
Francis Poldark Esquire, of Trenwith!

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.679
Wouldn't be the first time today.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:23.439
I...I met a man, handing out pamphlets
defaming Ross in the grossest manner

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.759
and I happen to know ofthe author.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.119
And so I went and paid him a visit.

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.879
And left him in no doubt
as to my opinion.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.439
George.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.239
Was that wise when he owns
the very roof over your head?

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.919
Oh, no doubt he's planning this moment
how to punish me.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.079
But he may be defrauded.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.159
Do not lose heart, Francis.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.479
Tomorrow's a new day.

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.719
A new day.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.719
And it may never come.

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.399
I wonder if I shouldn't go to Bodmin.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.319
To what purpose?

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.879
To be with Francis.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.599
And his cousin?

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.759
Ross has Demelza.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.919
Hm.

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.039
Be advised, sir.
The woman approaching is a harlot

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.679
and must, on no account, be admitted.

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.919
Excuse me, sirs.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.599
Entry to the assembly rooms
is for voters only.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.119
I've come to see Mr Penvenen.
He particularly asked for me.

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.519
- I bet he did.
- You can't come in.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:16.159
I beg you to let me through.
'Tis all the reason I've come to Bodmin.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.319
- My husband's life depends on it.
- Move along now.

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.079
Move along now!

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:27.159
Are you sure Dr Enys was agreeable
to 'ee sharing his chamber?

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.599
This is a small chamber, sir.
And but a single bed.

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.199
I shall not be needing a bed.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.599
(Angry shouting from outside)

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.639
(Door opens and closes)

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.839
Oh, my dear, I was so worried.
The crowds in the square...

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.039
What is it? Did it all go wrong?

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.199
Not exactly.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.599
(Footsteps)

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.239
I'm in no mood for visitors.

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.399
- (Keys jangle)
- Sounds ominous.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.079
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.239
I was writing to my wife.

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:34.079
I've not come to fight, Ross. But to confess.

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:41.639
Confess myself disarmed. Impressed.

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.839
Well, of course you might have guessed
Elizabeth would ask me to intervene.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.879
But would you guess that Francis did, too?

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.919
That Ray Penvenen
tried to fight your corner?

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:58.559
Alfred Barbery, Lord Deveran.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.399
How do you inspire such loyalty?
It impresses me.

00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:12.279
I see its value. I could use it.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.919
I could do what they asked me to do.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.519
Remove the hostile witnesses,
drop a word in the ear ofthe prosecution.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.479
I could even take the stand
and give you a character reference.

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.039
How would that sway the jury?

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.199
The very man whose cousin perished?

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:35.079
What do you say, Ross?

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.359
Will you meet me halfway?

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.319
Will you take the hand offriendship?

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.359
Forgive me.

00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:59.559
Are you truly so deluded?

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.799
Do you think I would
ever shake your hand?

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.159
(Chuckles)

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.159
No. No, not for a single moment.

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.639
But when you go to the gallows,

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.319
I'll be able to say, hand on heart,
to Elizabeth,

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.799
I offered Ross Poldark my help
and he turned me down.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.799
So, thank you.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:39.319
For being every bit as predictable
as I hoped you'd be.

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.159
And thank you.

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.999
For reminding me what can
and cannot be bought.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.159
(Keys jangle)

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.319
(Cell door clangs shut)

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.359
My dear, where are you going?

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.519
I have one last thing I must try.

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.319
(Bell tolling)
