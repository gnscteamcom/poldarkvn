WEBVTT

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.599
(Waves crashing on beach)

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.319
(Keys jangle in distance)

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.679
(Footsteps approaching)

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.919
(Voices shouting in distance)

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.159
- Sounds lively out there.
- The rabble are out in force tonight.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.639
The list...

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.679
..ofthose summoned to speak against you.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.559
ROSS: A long list.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.559
Jud Paynter?

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.599
You know him?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.759
He was my servant.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.199
Well, now he's the Crown's.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.159
And the testimony of a loyal servant
against his former master...

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.319
Nail in the coffin.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.479
(Angry shouting)

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.759
(Chamber music plays)

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.839
Mistress Poldark, how delightful!

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.639
Mr Penvenen.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.679
To think of us meeting again so soon!

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.559
And may I introduce my niece, Caroline.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.479
Mistress Demelza Poldark of Nampara.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.519
And Mr Unwin Trevaunance.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.639
Are you here for the election, ma'am?

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.439
Er... No, ma'am, for the assizes.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.359
Oh, yes. Unwin, were you not telling me
there was a Poldark to be tried this week?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.079
That's my husband, ma'am.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.959
And is he guilty? What did he do?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.279
(Trevaunance clears throat)

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.519
Well, if I were the judge, I would sentence him
to be returned to his wife without delay.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.399
(Hubbub of voices)

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.319
That must be the crowd, clamouring for me.
Will you join me outside?

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.479
Why not? I enjoy a baying mob.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.319
May I be of service, ma'am?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.839
Well, since you mention it...

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.799
Oh, for pity's sake!

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.319
Must we always have these dire predictions?

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.679
Not once have I known you forecast
an outcome which was remotely cheering!

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.759
I'm not divining the future.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.999
I'm entertaining myselfwith a game of Snap.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.399
Go to Bodmin, Elizabeth.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.679
You'll never be satisfied till you do.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.559
This election? 'Tis a joke!

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.999
What difference do it make?
Who suffers when mines close?

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.319
Not fancy folk.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.919
Stuffed to t'gizzards wi' beef - while we scrape
by on black bread and beech leaves!

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.479
In France, they wouldn't stand for it.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.559
It's come here to Bodmin soon enough, and it
won't be long before it reaches you in Truro.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.559
Bin out there, 'ave 'ee?
'Tis like a powder keg!

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.559
Dr Enys!

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.119
- What brings 'ee here?
- Same as you, Prudie.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.919
To speak for Cap'n Ross?

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.799
As I'm sure we all will.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.759
Mr Paynter, are you ill?

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.279
Dammit, can a man not study the innards of
a jug without bein' clepp'd malingerer?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.119
I commend you to your studies.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.719
Goin' out there? 'Ave a care.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.919
'Twill take but a spark...
(Mimics explosion)

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.559
Your defence is proving more of a challenge
than I'd anticipated.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.599
Do you have the document from Harris Pascoe?

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.479
Your last will and testament?

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.039
Influence?

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.999
I do not have that sort of influence, ma'am.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.879
And it would prejudice your husband's case,
not help it.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.399
- But if it was put the right way?
- If it were put any way, ma'am.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.119
No, no, no.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.319
I wouldn't dream oftrying to persuade a judge.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.239
Believe me, I sympathise. I really do.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.399
And I do dearly hope that the court
look kindly on your husband.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.799
But the surest way of attaining the opposite,
would be to try and influence the judge.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.079
I see.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.439
(She sighs)

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.599
Forgive me, sir.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.599
I'm a little despairing.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.359
Is he...a kindly man?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.399
In appearance, I mean?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.999
Justice Lister? Somewhat severe.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.439
- Small and stout?
- Tall and lean.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.959
Does he likes his port?

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.799
Resolutely sober.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.359
Ifthere's to be a reckoning,
it's as well to have one's affairs in order...

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.439
..little as there is of value.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.719
My household effects,
my shares in Wheal Leisure...

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.599
Mr Pascoe mentions a Wheal Grace.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.639
My father's old mine.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.679
- It's derelict.
- But still yours.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.639
And still deemed an asset.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.919
Not by me!
I deem it a worthless hole in the ground.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.959
But by all means, let me bequeath it to my wife,
along with my other debts and liabilities.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.439
(He exhales heavily)

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.039
I really have left her nothing.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.599
- Excuse me...
- No.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.319
- Ouch!
- Oh, dear, madam, my deepest apologies.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.319
- Are you hurt?
- Only my dignity, sir.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.999
May I assist you to a chair?
Some port, perhaps?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.039
No, thank you.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.199
I never touch it, sir.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.359
(Low chatter)

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.079
- Are you stalking me, Dr Enys?
- Not at all, ma'am.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.119
But now I'm here, may I be of service?

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.359
Can you prescribe
something to keep me awake?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.959
- You find the election boring?
- Exceedingly dull.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.759
And the rabble out there insufferable.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.679
Oh, I grant you, it seems unpleasant.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.319
But take each man for himself
and he's likeable enough.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.439
Are you a Jacobin, like Ross Poldark?

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.679
It's clear you don't know Ross Poldark.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.519
No, but I expect to tomorrow, and I'd hope for
better entertainment than I've had here tonight.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.319
Perhaps you're the sort
who takes a window at Tyburn

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.279
for the pleasure of seeing someone
choked to death?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.399
And is it any business of yours if I am?

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.439
No, I'm thankful not.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.479
MAN: Gentlemen, I have here the results
ofthe Bodmin constituency.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.599
Chenhalls, Michael: 2,250.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.199
(Cheering)

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.679
Dagge, Hugh: 1 ,203.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.199
Trevaunance, Unwin: 1 ,203.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.559
It's a tie for second place!

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.439
A farcical state of affairs!

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.479
There'll have to be a second vote
to decide the remaining seat.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.719
There can be no question ofthat.
Regard yourself as elected and act accordingly.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.799
- But how? I'm tied in second place!
- The chair, man. Take a second chair.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.879
Claim your seat before Dagge has chance to
contest it. Come now, there's no time to lose!

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.199
(Mob shouting)

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.879
Who are ye?

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.439
- Er...well...
- D'you know me? D'you speak for me?

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.959
- I'm your elected member...
- Who elected ye?

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.759
Did I? Did any here?

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.919
(Angry shouts of denial)

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.159
You don't speak for me!

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.919
But maybe this will!

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.479
Turn it round.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.639
(Angry shouting)

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.359
Get me back inside!

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.079
I hope he brought his rose-water!

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.679
There'll be a reckoning, mark ye!

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.919
Commoners don't 'old wi' bein'
tramped underfoot!

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.199
Bring down the fancy folk an' let the poor rise!

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.079
Ye shan't muzzle me!
I'm a free man - I've a right to speak!

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.719
Urgh!

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.559
Apparently not.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.359
This has not helped our cause.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.759
Mission accomplished.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.119
Unwin has established his claim.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.159
Almost at the expense of his own life!

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.199
Is it always like this in Bodmin?

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.759
I couldn't say. I live near Truro.
I'm only here for tomorrow's trial.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.799
You speak for Ross Poldark?

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.359
I look forward to seeing you acquit yourself.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.519
Happily, it's not I who is on trial.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.359
Are you quite certain ofthat?

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.399
You flatter yourself, ma'am.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.279
Are all men so odiously conceited?

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.159
I shouldn't put conceit
as the particular property of one sex.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.679
How gracious of you to correct me, sir!

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.639
I wonder you're so solicitous
for one you so clearly despise.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.679
You're mistaken, madam.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.839
I neither solicit nor despise.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.879
That rabble!
Have they no respect for their betters?

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.319
Or for the law?

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.439
Someone needs to take them
by the scruff ofthe neck and...

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.919
Oh, good God!

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.839
What is the woman doing?

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.519
She'll hang her husband if she's not careful.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:14.039
So let me ask Your Lordship - how can a body
judge if a person be tellin' the truth?

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.399
Well...

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.919
Some of 'em be so downright convincin'
and have all the evidence to back 'em up.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.519
But ifthe evidence be false?

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.319
Excuse me.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.879
For instance, erm...if a body did
know the truth about an accused...

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.159
..wouldn't he or she then be obliged to speak?

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.199
Most assuredly,
in the appropriate place.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.559
Which would be the court.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.919
Then put the case, sir,
that a body know'd some other body

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.719
who paid money so that
other bodies might speak lies.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.159
You list a great many bodies, ma'am.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.759
Are any ofthem here now?

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.559
Well, in truth, seen as you do ask me directly,
Your Lordship...

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.399
Mistress Demelza, what a pleasure to see you.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.639
And Your Lordship - out unusually late?

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.439
Indeed, sir.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.479
Though not unagreeably detained.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.239
You must be grateful for the distraction, ma'am.
Did you speak ofyour husband?

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.799
- Of course you will meet him tomorrow.
- Sir?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.679
Ross Poldark,
when he comes before you in court.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.039
Oh...you were not aware?

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.919
No, sir, I was not.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.759
You will pardon me, ma'am, sir.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.719
Let me accompany you.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.079
What do you make ofthis assault
on our newly-elected MP?

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.399
Barely escaped with his life. Ifthis goes on,
we'll have a revolution on our hands.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.879
In Cornwall?

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.599
People are fearful, sir. People are wondering
when a clear message will be sent.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.359
Those who stir up disorder should expect
the severest penalty. Would you not agree?

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.439
I do, sir.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.159
Beg pardon, sur, there's a gentleman within.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.799
A Mr Francis Poldark?

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.119
Oh, yes.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:22.079
Francis?

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.519
Locked, sir, from the inside.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.639
(Rattles lock)

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.199
- We may need to break it down.
- Nay, 'twill damage it.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.839
Damn it, man, Mr Poldark may be ill.
He may even...

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.199
(Door opens)

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.319
This is the statement I've prepared for you.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.119
You may find it a little contrite for your taste.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.599
There are limits - even if one's neck is at stake.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.719
So you'd go to the gallows
on a point of principle?

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.999
Of course it's your life, to do as you please.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.039
Are you a fatalist, Enys?

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.719
Or do you believe that we are
masters of our own destiny?

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.999
- Well...
- Because a short while ago I...

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.959
..pointed this at my head and it misfired.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.039
The flint went down
but the powder did not ignite.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.799
Since then I've been trying to decide
whether to do it again.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.399
I agree, it's in very poor taste to use
your hospitality for such a purpose.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.559
But I erm...

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.599
Anyway, the thing's not done, so...

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.799
..for the moment, you have a talkative
companion instead of a silent one.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.759
I don't understand.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.919
Why would you wish...?

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.999
Francis, you are young, propertied, respected,
you have a beautiful wife, a healthy son...

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.719
Stop!

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.119
Or I shall weep forjoy!

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.919
Let's have some brandy, hm?

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.839
At any rate, I can do no damage
until I have fresh powder.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.559
I hope you will reconsider.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.519
Here's to the devil.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.839
(Glasses clink)

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.399
Lord knows whose side he's been on tonight.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.039
Why do you hate him?

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.199
What has he ever done to deserve it?

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.439
I doubt you'd understand.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.479
Because I am not so well-bred as you?

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.519
I am a miner's daughter. But you are a
blacksmith's grandson. What is the difference?

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.559
The difference is that you will always be a
miner's daughter, whereas I am a gentleman.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.839
- I am a gentleman's wife.
- Soon to be a gentleman's widow.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.839
CLYMER: Got a wife?

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.599
Got a family?

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.039
You don't think it's worth making
this concession for their sakes?

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.239
I appreciate your efforts.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.679
But I cannot put my name
to beggary and flattery.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.839
Damn it, man, you have no choice!

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.759
The case against you's too strong.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.879
It's not a question of whether
you'll be found guilty, but when.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.559
And what the sentence will be.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.719
All you can do is paint a penitent figure,
so that you may escape the worst.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.319
The worst, I tell you.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.199
Perhaps you will consider that
before you sleep tonight.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.359
(Keys jangle then turn in lock)

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.279
Did you have better luck?

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.799
If anything, I've made it worse.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.159
What did you hope to achieve?

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.919
I don't know.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.679
Anything.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.159
Verity, I lost my child.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.599
How could I bear it if I lost Ross too?

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.879
(Sobs)

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.039
Ask me, Enys.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.759
Am I cleaning it to put away or...

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.639
..do I intend to use it again?

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.159
Do you?

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.439
If I see a suitable target.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.279
(Coins clinking)

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.399
What 'ee be up to, 'ee lizardy,
lousedy piss-a-bed?

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.319
Up to? I?

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.359
Innocent as a new-born babe.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.839
Witnesses primed
and we've augmented the crowd

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.239
with persons who share our view
ofthe accused

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.679
and will not scruple
to make their voices heard.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.319
- And His Lordship?
- Is immune to persuasion.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.359
On the contrary.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.239
I believe he was persuaded last night
without a penny changing hands.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.719
(Bell tolls in distance)

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.759
GUARD: Jack Tripp, on your feet!

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.479
Do you go before the court?

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.519
With head held high.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.559
And sore, no doubt.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.599
Not fer long.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.039
The noose is a great curer fer 'eadaches!

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.719
I wish you justice - ifthere's any to be found.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.679
Which there ain't - as we both do know.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.319
(Keys jangling)

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.479
So luck it must be.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.119
For us both, then.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.799
As ringleader and instigator ofthe affray,
in which you did, unlawfully,

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.999
assemble together
a violent and unruly mob,

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.159
you have been found guilty.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.159
It now only remains for me to pass
the dreadful sentence ofthe law,

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.559
which is that you be taken
from hence to a place of execution,

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.959
where you will be hanged by the neck
until you die.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.399
CLERK: Call Ross Poldark!

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.399
(Clamouring)

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.719
(Angry shouting)

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.159
MAN: Murderer!

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.519
WOMAN: Murder!

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.999
CLERK: Order!

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.799
Why do they cry "murder"?
That is not the charge.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.159
Silence in court!

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.279
(Hissing and shouting)

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.239
- So many against him?
- Only the ones paid by George.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.399
But ifthe jury believe them?

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:54.439
Ross Vennor Poldark,
you stand accused that you did incite riot,

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.559
viciously attack a customs officer,

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.279
and did plunder diverse goods
belonging to a ship in distress.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.279
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.159
(Clamouring)

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.919
- (Door bursts open)
- Let the court beware this man!

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.559
A devil in gent's clothing!

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:19.319
He stole my daughter, debauch'd an' left her
unfit for neither man nor beast!

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.799
Have him taken.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.759
And when I did go to the rescue o' my child,
this man did viciously assault I -

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.319
a poor God-fearing man in his dotage -

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.479
with fists and with weapons.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.719
I tell 'ee, this man do think himself
above the law,

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.159
do think he may take whate'er he please
an' ne'er pay the price for it.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.359
I do implore the court to see
thatjustice be done,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.919
in the name of I an' all
who've suffered at his hands!

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.079
Continue.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.159
Gentlemen ofthe jury.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.199
You'll recall that in this summer's great winds...

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.519
..a ship got into distress and was driven
ashore on Hendrawna Beach,

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.559
just below the house ofthe accused.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.399
You might expect that such a man's first thought
would be the safety ofthe poor souls aboard.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.879
Instead, he sought to rouse
the lawless spirits ofthe district,

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.439
so that when the wreck came in,
it might be plundered with the utmost dispatch.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.079
Witnesses will testify that the accused
personally directed the plunder.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.199
And that survivors from the wreck
were beaten as they struggled ashore.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.119
When a contingent of
soldiers and excise men arrived,

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.959
the prisoner warned them not to interfere
and threatened them with violence ifthey did.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.959
When they nonetheless went down on the
beach, they were set upon by the accused.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.239
One ofthem received near-fatal injuries.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.559
Did you see the prisoner
attack the customs officer?

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.599
Yes, sur.
Seed him strike a blow 'cross his pate.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.959
- And kick him when he's down!
- You liar! That's a lie!

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.119
(Angry shouting)

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.039
- "Roused from sleep", you say?
- Aye, sur. By 'im, sur.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.279
- Saying what?
- "Pickings for all!

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.159
Hendrawna beach! Wreck's comin' in!
Strip 'er to the last plank!"

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.519
When you reached Hendrawna Beach,
what did you see the accused do?

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.079
Pluck cargo from the sea, pile it up on
the strand and direct others to do the same.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.199
Did you see him assault the customs officer?

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.879
Aye, sur. Assault, sur. Terrible thing, sur.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.719
(Angry shouting)

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.119
Order!

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.919
Ephraim Oliver, you were on the beach
on the night of January 7th last.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.279
What did you see?

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.519
That man striked a gauger across his skull and
kicked 'im to the ground an' leave 'im for dead.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.559
William Fiddick, how close were you
when he struck John Coppard, the excise man?

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.399
Close as you be to me, sur,
an' felt the blow like 'twas across me own 'ead.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:02.319
Sergeant Tremayne, the prisoner warned you
not to go to the beach, yet you did so. Why?

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.279
Well, I felt he was casting doubts on my resolve
and goading me to do so.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.879
(Breathes heavily)

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.359
Oh, Demelza!

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.079
Is it not intolerable in there?
I could scarce breathe.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.239
Nor I.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.519
I came for Francis.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.839
I never thanked you...

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.039
for tending me in my sickness.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.799
You saved my son.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.079
And at such a cost.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.399
- How can you bear it?
- I'm with child again.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.519
Is...Ross glad?

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.679
I've not told him.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.319
- Ifthings go ill today...
- Pray God they do not.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.319
- I must...
- Of course.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.599
Call Jud Paynter.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.119
(Prosecutor clears throat)

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.519
Describe to us, Mr Paynter,
what took place the night ofthe gale.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.559
So there's Prudie - that's the wife -
snorin' fit to rouse the dead.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:03.159
When along come Cap'n Ross, sayin',
"Ship gone ashore down Hendrawna."

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.319
I cannot believe
he would turn against Ross like this.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.519
- Yes?
- Yes.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.999
- And what did he do?
- Do?

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.919
Did he urge you to do anything?

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.159
Urge? Oh, aye.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.119
'Ee says to I...

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.119
"Roust the rest ofthe village
an' head down to the shore."

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.279
- Did he give you a reason?
- Reason?

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.839
Aye.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.639
"Come now," he says, "sharp as 'ee can,

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.359
for likely there's...

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.319
..women an' children aboard who
need saving from a watery grave."

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.799
Come, man, recollect yourself.
Think what you're saying.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.279
Aye, that's what 'ee said, right enough.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.599
I tell you, man, to think again. What you say is
not in accordance with your sworn statement.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.839
"When Captain Poldark came to my house,
he told me to hurry and rouse the village

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.399
because there was a wreck

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.039
and the sooner it was stripped the better,
before the authorities turned up."

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.079
No, sur, I never said them words
an' I never thought 'em neither.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.919
I remind you, Mr Paynter,
this statement was made before witnesses

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.279
and read aloud to you before you signed.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.199
Aye, well, sur, see...I is 'ard of hearing.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.999
So it's likely I misheard what they said
and they misheard what I said.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.119
Mr Bull, I would have thought it was clear
that this witness has committed perjury -

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.399
either now
or when he made his original statement.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.319
I would suggest that you turn him out ofthe box
and get on with your case.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.319
You should have brandished less carrot
and more stick.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.239
We could not possibly have foreseen...

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.039
I beg to differ.
These people have peculiar loyalties.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.999
What of Captain Bray?
Did you manage to prevail there?

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.959
CLERK: Call Captain Bray.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:04.959
Describe, Captain Bray, the sight that met
your eyes as you came ashore that night.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.759
Like Dante's Inferno.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.239
Drunken men cavorting, mules struggling
beneath the spoils from the ship.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.759
All semblance of order gone.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.559
'Twas as close to hell as I ever hope to come.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.719
And your passengers and crew?

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.239
Confronted by viciousness ofthe grossest kind.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.759
I had to stand guard to prevent them
being torn to pieces.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.839
Thank you, Captain Bray.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.479
Your description would strike a chill
into the heart of any decent human being.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.919
(Murmurs of assent)

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.839
The prisoner begs leave to question the witness.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.119
Granted.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.999
Captain Bray, do you recall seeing me
on the beach that night?

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.159
You came and offered me and my passengers
shelter in your house.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.639
And did you see or hear me
encouraging anyone to wreck your ship?

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.679
It was dark, sir.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.559
But I don't believe I'd set eyes on you
until that moment.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.279
Did you see the meeting of myself
and the captain ofthe soldiers?

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.639
As I recall, you warned him
not to go down to the beach.

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.599
And did I accompany you into my house, sir?

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.839
- You did.
- Thank you.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.959
One moment. How long did the accused
stay with you after you entered the house?

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.559
About five minutes.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.319
He said that his wife was ill
and he needed to tend her.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.559
When did you see him again?

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.239
About two hours later.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.799
So there was nothing to prevent him
leaving when you were settled

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.879
and returning to the beach
to attack the excise men?

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.799
- I suppose not.
- Thank you. You may stand down.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.359
(Murmur of conversation)

00:32:54.200 --> 00:33:00.479
It's no exaggeration to suggest
that what we have here is a revolutionary.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.399
Self-serving, contemptuous of his class,
careless of other's property.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:09.799
Of all the crimes committed that night, this man
was the instigator and chief perpetrator.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.039
It is not within my scope to call to attention
the previous acts of lawlessness

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.559
- that have marred the accused's character.
- Objection!

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.239
Confine yourselfto the present allegations,
Mr Bull.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.519
But it is relevant to draw conclusions
from statements made by the accused

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.359
at the time of his arrest,

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.359
statements purporting to explain his actions,
justify them,

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:35.479
and which brand him an obvious admirer
ofthe bloodshed and tyranny in France!

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.799
(Shouts of agreement)

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.359
Asked if he encouraged the riot
which broke out on the beach:

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.039
"I did not consider it a riot."

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.879
Asked if he approved of
plunder and lawlessness:

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.399
"Do you approve ofwhole families being
without sufficient food to keep them alive?"

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.759
Asked what part he played
in the death of Matthew Sanson:

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.399
"Regrettably none whatsoever."

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.959
If you have ever heard a more damning
indictment from a prisoner's own mouth,

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.479
I would frankly be amazed.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.639
Such a man is a danger to us all.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.359
The Country and Justice itself
deserves the severest penalty.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.959
The Crown rests its case.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.959
- (Cheering and applause)
- (Judge bangs gavel)

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.759
Witnesses for the defence?

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.639
Are there any?

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.079
Call Dwight Enys.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.519
My Lord, I am the physician who attended
Captain Poldark's wife and child

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.999
during their attack ofthe putrid throat.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.439
At that time I was constantly in the house
and can testify that Captain Poldark

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.599
had no sleep for almost a week.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:59.719
His only child died and was buried
but a few days before the wreck.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.719
On the day itself...

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.359
..I formed the opinion that he had suffered
a mental breakdown.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.799
I consider that any strangeness in his actions
should almost entirely be attributed to that.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.959
- You're an apothecary?
- A physician, sir.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.919
A licentiate ofthe London College of Physicians
and a Cornishman by birth.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.719
- And an expert on mental afflictions?
- I did not say so.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.839
Then your views on the matter can hardly
be expected to carry much weight.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.479
I believe they can, sir.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:47.479
In my view, Captain Poldark was, temporarily,
through grief and lack of sleep, not himself.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.039
Do you consider that anyone
who loses a child and a few nights' sleep

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.039
is justified in creating a riot?

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.479
I do not believe he created the riot.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.919
We require your opinion as a physician, sir,
not as a friend or drinking companion.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.519
I speak purely as a physician and base
my opinion on clinical observation.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.719
Captain Poldark was unsteady on his feet
and disordered in his remarks.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.079
- Perhaps he was drunk.
- He had not touched a drink in days.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.079
My Lord, when his infant daughter died,
a great many people came to the funeral.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.839
All of society, from highest to low.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.919
He's held in very great esteem.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.079
But with his wife ill,
it was impossible to give them refreshment.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.679
This weighed heavy on his mind.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.159
And I suggest to you
that he did provide for them.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.959
In rousing the rabble and leading them to
the wreck, he both assuaged his conscience

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.479
and filled his larder with pillaged goods.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.799
That was not my meaning, sir.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.719
Thank you, sir. You paint a very clear picture
ofthe prisoner's state of mind.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.279
(Angry shouting)

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.039
Enough!

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.119
Remove these persons from the court.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.719
They should be taken out and whipped!

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.799
CLERK:
The court will take a short adjournment.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.999
We could not have hoped for a betterjudge.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.039
Poldark will surely hang!

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.679
Yes.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.839
That is what you wanted?

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.279
The mine he will leave to his wife?

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.199
We can soon acquire the shares.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.439
Was she not his kitchen maid?
She will give us no trouble.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.479
Do not believe it.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.639
You will be celebrating tonight.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.159
I certainly intend to.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.119
You could not bear to keep away.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.439
- I was concerned.
- Hm. For me?

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.439
Do I not have cause?

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.759
Well, as you can see, I am well.
So had you not better return to Trenwith?

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.639
Having come so far, I may as well stay.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.719
Ross will be gratified.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.519
Are you?

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.319
Are you resolved?

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.719
To prostrate myself and beg for mercy?

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.199
Good God, man,
do you not see what's happening?

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.599
You stand accused of riot and lawlessness.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.279
This country lives in dread of France.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.799
This court must be seen to set an example.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.119
That is why you must grovel.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:36.079
Do so now or you will not live
to see the sun rise tomorrow.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.639
My Lord...gentlemen ofthe jury.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:34.959
I can only apologise that this case
has taken so much ofyour time.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:41.159
I will try to take as little more as may be
necessary to beg your clemency.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.559
It is true that I saw a wreck come in...

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.879
..that I rode and told several villagers...

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.799
..that a number of people came upon
the beach and that items were carried away.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.199
Though not by me.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.559
My house was searched and none were found.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.359
Why?

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.919
Because I took none.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.919
The Counsel has suggested
that I'm a revolutionary...

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.199
..that these people are revolutionaries...

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.199
branded with a desire to overthrow authority.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.479
Nothing could be further from the truth.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:40.639
The people of Sawle, Mellin and Grambler
who came upon the beach that day

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:46.599
were ordinary people - no more or no less
law-abiding loyal subjects than any here.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.359
As to what happened
when they came up on the beach,

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.279
I ask you to think ofthe traditions of our county.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.319
Our people scour the beaches for flotsam.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.479
This is commonly known.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.759
But in times of dire need,

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:11.359
when fathers have seen their children without
a crust for their bellies or a rag for their backs,

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.559
these pickings have been the means
of keeping ordinary people alive.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.399
What else would you have them do?

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:28.319
After they have rescued the crew
and brought goods ashore,

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.639
are they then to await
the arrival ofthe excise men

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.119
and watch them carry offthe goods
that they have salvaged?

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.359
You ask if I was in my right mind?

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.799
Well, you've heard evidence that I was not.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:47.399
But is it insanity to think that rich pickings
strewn across a beach

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.639
are better used to sustain those in need

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.399
than returned to those whose only goal is profit?

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.559
I cannot believe it.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.399
I will not believe it.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.439
I make no apology for my actions.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.999
In truth, I would do the same again.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.359
Thank you.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.919
I've heard more penitent speeches.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.679
But rarely more eloquent.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.839
- My apologies.
- Mm.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.399
What happens now?

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.559
The Judge's summing up.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.959
I would not expect much benevolence.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.919
Gentlemen ofthe jury,
this man stands accused of riot, theft

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.279
and assaulting an officer ofthe Crown.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:57.399
Your duty is to decide, beyond reasonable
doubt, ifthe prisoner is guilty or innocent.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.639
But in law, if you are satisfied
that a riot took place,

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.159
you only need to be satisfied
that the prisoner was involved,

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.799
to find him guilty as a principal.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.479
The prisoner has attempted to find
mitigating circumstances

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.119
in the distress generally prevailing
amongst the poor.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.879
You may find this an admirable sentiment,

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.519
but you would be failing in your duty

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.279
if you allowed it
to influence yourjudgment in any way.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.199
Will you now consider your verdict?

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.239
You may retire if you wish.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.759
DWIGHT: Bad, is it not?

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.919
Very bad.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.239
Not that I don't admire his stubbornness but...

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.919
..he'll pay for it.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.599
Will I have a chance to say goodbye to my wife?

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.199
You will be removed from court
and taken directly to your fate.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.599
"The quality of mercy is not strained

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.159
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath:"

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:36.399
And God knows, it droppeth sometimes
on those who least deserve it.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.839
I must congratulate you on your eloquence.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.839
You almost convinced me I was guilty.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.279
In truth, I believe there's nothing
either you or anyone could have said

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.439
to change the old man's mind.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.079
He seems determined
to make an example of you.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:00.399
They're coming back.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.279
Gentlemen ofthe jury...

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.559
..have you reached a verdict?

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.759
We have.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.679
Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.919
We find him...

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.799
..not guilty on all three charges.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.439
- I thought we'd lost him!
- I was sure of it!

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.679
Oh, Francis, dear brother...
Can we not take heart from this?

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.599
Is there not hope in it for all?

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.759
- Hope?
- Of a reconciling?

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.519
Of you and I gladly, gladly.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:32.079
But, Verity, for your husband?
While I live and breathe - it will never happen.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.319
So he will come home after all.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.359
Yes.

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.519
No, no, don't stop on my account.

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.479
I wonder if you would have wept so prettily
had I not come home.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.439
Why would you not have come home, Francis?

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.599
Let's not distress ourselves to no purpose.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.759
I am coming home.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.959
And so is Ross.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.799
And tomorrow the sun will rise again.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.399
So let us count our blessings.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.439
Seems I shan't be rid of you yet, Captain.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.279
A pity. I was looking forward to dealing
with the sensible side ofthe family.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.319
Is it over? Are 'ee free?

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.359
It would appear so.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.519
(Both laugh)

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.879
(Jaunty tune)

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.279
(She giggles)

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.919
How did he get off?

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:49.119
How could the accursed jury disregard
all the evidence and find him not guilty?

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.599
And to think I let my uncle persuade me
against pressing a charge of murder!

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.199
I tell you, there was not one atom of proof
and we could not have manufactured it.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.479
And Paynter recanted!

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.639
He will pay for it shortly.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.599
What now?

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.599
Do we...accept defeat?

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.759
By no means.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.919
Wheal Leisure is his one real asset.
We must set about buying up shares.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.159
When I control the mine, I control Ross.

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.319
And er...Francis?

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.239
His finances are in your hands.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.279
You could break him tomorrow.

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.319
I could.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.199
But for the moment,
I intend to make no move at all.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.639
- You care nothing for his good will.
- Not his.

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.799
But there is another person to consider.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:48.919
Not guilty!

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.359
As I expected.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.039
Sit here, my dear. (Clears throat)

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.999
- May I get you a glass ofwine?
- Thank you.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.959
Stay a little longer with us!

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:18.519
Nay, Jinny, leave 'em be.
They'll be wantin' to be away home.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.199
- Caroline.
- Thank you.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.039
Thank you.

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.279
- To Westminster!
- To Ross Poldark!

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.519
You must toast as your uncle bids you, Caroline.

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.039
You are his ward and you must obey his wishes.

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.799
And what are his wishes?

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:49.199
Why, for you to engage yourself
to a man of substance and repute.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:51.799
I intend to.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.959
(Fiddle playing)

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.079
Here's to Ross!

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.239
ALL: To Ross!

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:07.879
Judas!

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.639
I might go to town tomorrow.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.279
I've a notion to engage a couple of servants.

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.759
And what sorts would 'ee be lookin' for?

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.639
Fiendishly hardworking...

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.079
pitifully grateful...

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.239
exceedingly cheap.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.519
Ifyou hear of any such,
tell them to make themselves known to me.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.519
You overlook one thing.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:52:02.479
Ross Poldark is alive and must be aware
of our attempts to render him otherwise.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.599
And?

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:11.039
He does not strike me as a man who takes such
things lying down. After all, he's a soldier.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.519
A renegade.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.479
Your point?

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:21.879
That in failing to get him hanged,
you have lef yourself exposed.

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.839
(Door opens)

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.719
I did not care for Bodmin.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.839
This is what I desire.

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.239
You, me...

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.599
..our house, candles burning...

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.319
..the scent of new-picked violets.

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.519
Maybe it's because I'm of common stock,
I'm so easily pleased.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.679
Common stock you are not.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.239
There is one thing I do desire.

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.519
A child in the crib.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.639
To take her place?

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.799
Not to make us forget her.

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.839
Do not wish it.

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.679
- Not ever?
- Not for now.

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.759
With our future so uncertain.

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.039
Our future looks kinder than we ever expected.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.159
Much kinder.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.359
I believe we agreed
you would not come to Bodmin.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.479
Yes, Ross, I believe that we did.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.679
Have I told you what I feel
about a disobedient wife?

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.759
Have I told you what I feel
about a reckless husband?
