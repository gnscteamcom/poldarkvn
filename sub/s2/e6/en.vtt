WEBVTT

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.959
(Sobs)

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.479
Still can't get used to Mister Francis bein' gone.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.439
Breaks my heart to think of him,
all fired up about those rock samples.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.479
When in the end, 'twas only quartz,
with schorl an' iron oxide mixed.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.679
- Fool's copper.
- Fool's copper.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.559
Leaving his widow with nothing
but debt and shares in a failing mine.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.399
I'm to Trenwith, to see Elizabeth.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.519
Is Verity's company not enough for her?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.559
Hup!

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.519
He comes to take Geoffrey Charles to the mine.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.759
And you?

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.239
I'm trustee of my son's shares in Wheal Grace,
which is why Ross brings me weekly reports.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.319
Sometimes twice-weekly.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.919
Uncle Ross is here, Mama!

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.599
Who else can I depend on?

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.679
(Hums cheerfully)

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.159
Is it done?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.319
"Mr Poldark, I give you notice

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.279
that your promissory note
for £1 ,000 plus interest at 40%,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.079
will fall due and must be paid in full."

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.919
The day after Christmas?

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.839
Do they serve plum pudding in debtors' prison?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.199
(Chuckles grimly)

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.799
Will you take my coat?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.359
- I do not feel the cold.
- I think you do.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.759
At any rate, you used to.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.839
At any rate, it's warmer than Trenwith.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.039
I must learn to grow a thicker skin.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.359
Can you?

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.719
Sometimes.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.239
I miss Francis.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.039
I miss him too.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.559
I never thought him the most practical of men,
yet now I realise how much he dealt with.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.319
Matters offinance, the estate, the servants...
decisions which now fall to me.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.319
Do not hesitate to call upon me, Elizabeth.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.079
Oh, I do. More often than I should.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.439
You have your own home, and wife and child.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.199
You seek to share my troubles,
yet never tell me your own.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.279
What of your debts?

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.879
The promissory note
which fell into George's hands?

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.519
Don't trouble yourself.
The sum was much exaggerated.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.279
And the mine?

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.479
How long can we continue with such poor yield?

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.559
For your sake and his, I will squeeze
out every last drop before it defeats us.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.799
Uncle Ross looks after us so well.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.959
Where would we be without him?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.319
Oi, maid, even your oils and vittles?

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.959
Not a word to Ross.
I don't want him thinkin' I fear the worst.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.279
'Ee do fear the worst!
If he go to prison,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.479
we'll need more'n a few tetties
to see us through.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.439
Hush your creenin'!

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.159
Ifthis be his last Christmas here for a while,
I mean to make it a goodly one.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.559
- Dr Enys.
- Is it anyone we know?

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.199
Nay, sir.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.999
Say he may be from the Parthesia.
It was wrecked last night off St Ann's.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.399
A cryin' waste o' life, don't 'ee think, Dr Enys?

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.599
I do indeed, Rosina.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.599
Take Rosina home. I'll see him buried.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.239
Nay, Rosina, 'tis needful 'ee take my arm,
for fear thy lipsy leg do buckle beneath 'ee.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.319
Oh, yes...Pascoe's asked to see me.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.039
He's received word from the Warleggans
regarding my promissory note.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.919
Could we not appeal to our wealthier friends,
at least to save you from debtors' prison?

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.119
Speak to people!

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.159
That's not how I work.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.359
So it's against your principles?
Nay, Ross, 'tis against your pride!

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.959
This stew is excellent.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.879
Of course.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.839
It's obvious.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.519
- Argh!
- What do 'ee do to her?

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.439
Rosina? Can you stand?

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.839
Don't be afraid.
I'll be here to catch you.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.759
Nay, surgeon. If anyone shall, 'tis I.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.039
Ah...I think...

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.239
I believe...

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.959
What did 'ee do?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.599
- 'Tis all mended. There be no pain.
- There was a displacement.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.439
You had it so long, the muscles
withered and caused inflammation.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.319
I'll put a bandage on it for now,
but soon you'll be able to manage without.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.119
'Tis a miracle!

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.199
No. Basic anatomy.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.439
There seem to be soldiers everywhere.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.879
Events across in France
make the gentry nervous.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.919
Events along the coast
make the gaugers watchful.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.039
- Has it arrived?
- As expected.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.119
The full amount, with interest.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.199
- I did enquire whether the Warleggans...
- I can guess the response.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.319
Quite so.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.479
It's to be paid six weeks hence.
The day afer Christmas.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.279
How are you, Tonkin?

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.079
Good of you to call, Cap'n. Few others do.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.719
You've no notion how much your visits
have helped me through.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.439
Not to mention this.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.279
Bless you, sir.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.119
- When do you expect to be released?
- Soon afer Christmas.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.279
Then it will be your turn to visit me.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.719
George Warleggan has a bill of mine
which I cannot pay.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.359
Surely you have assets?

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.119
Your shares in Wheal Leisure?

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.799
Does the mine not prosper?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.439
My shares are worth about £600,
not even half ofwhat I owe.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.559
Besides, I would not give them the satisfaction.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.479
Then you will suffer.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.679
Then I will suffer.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.239
- Ah! Miss Penvenen.
- Captain Poldark.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.319
Seven months away
have given me an appetite for such sights.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.039
And doubtless they for you.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.079
I was most grieved
to hear of your cousin's death.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.919
Thank you.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.959
We miss him greatly.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.759
He was your partner in the mine, I believe?

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.879
Were you able to continue the venture?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.039
It goes on.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.759
- Profitably?
- Not profitably.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.159
- And how is Dr Enys?
- A worker of miracles!

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.039
I just came through Sawle and I heard tell
of his curing a village girl of her lameness.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.879
Rosina Hoblyn?

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.679
- You know her?
- Of her. How was it done?

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.439
No doubt Dr Enys will enlighten you
soon enough.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.999
(Spurs horse on)

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.159
Did you know Caroline had returned?

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.159
(Clears throat)
As a matter offact, yes.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:56.199
The attachment's bad, I know,
and it's my weakness but I cannot shake it.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.759
No doubt it will end badly
and I'll have myjust deserts.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.799
Possibly.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.559
It seems fate does as it pleases.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.439
And it has nothing to do
with strength or weakness shown.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.759
Take Francis.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.679
Was there ever a sorrier or less deserved end?

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.159
To walk out ofthis house and in an hour,
to drown like a dog in a well?

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.119
And for nothing.
That's... That's what I most deplore,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.479
the wanton, useless waste of it.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.279
The quirks offate...

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.599
..which make nonsense of all our striving.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.719
95 years of age. What do you think ofthat?

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.039
I think it's high time the coffin-maker
started taking measurements.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.639
Head ofthe family.
Mistress ofthis house.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.639
And so I intend to remain.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.799
Good luck with that, old hag.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.079
(Footsteps approaching)

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.399
Elizabeth!

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.639
You look pale. Are you unwell?

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.239
I've brought a small token for my godson.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.319
- I know you'll accept nothing for yourself.
- Well, I...

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.479
Are you looking forward to Christmas?

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.839
I wish I were. Entertaining on a grand scale
is not my preference.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.879
But my uncle's very thick with Tony Boscoigne,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.279
and no doubt there's some scheme afoot
to throw me under the hooves of his sisters.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.519
- Or so your mother believes.
- You've seen her?

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.999
Oh.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.719
I'd not intended to mention.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.599
I have on occasion over the last few months
prevailed upon her to dine with me.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.759
You know how much I admire her.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.199
She speaks very highly of you.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.999
- She has shared with me certain concerns.
- Oh?

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.039
In the wake of Francis...forgive me...

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.399
certain outstanding debts of his...
accumulating interest...

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.439
- which must be dealt with.
- Of course.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.999
But not until you're out of mourning,
and well beyond.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.759
You're very kind, George.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.039
As your friend, it's the very least I can do.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.199
(Clattering and pounding)

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.079
HENSHAWE:
Something amiss with that engine.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.119
I've sent for Trevithick.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.839
Is it worth the while,
given how little she's yielding?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.519
I wonder that.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.239
It's a cryin' shame we never found
that lode Mark Daniel spoke of.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.879
Perhaps he was mistook.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.959
He was an experienced miner.
He knew what he was looking at.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.599
Then it's a pity
he can't be found and asked the question.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.239
Where?

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.119
(Grunting and squealing)

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.079
Ross continues to vex society.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.399
- What's he done now?
- What has he not done?

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.359
Graced the Poldark family pew at church,
taken his seat as magistrate on the bench.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.399
As head ofthe Poldark family,
these things are expected of him.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.599
Oh, you know Ross and expectation!

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:34.719
Besides, I've suspicion he'd think he was more
than fulfillin' his duties in other ways.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.519
Towards Elizabeth, for instance?

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.759
Does that trouble you?

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:47.639
Ross never tells me what goes on
in his meetings with her, and I never ask him.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.759
But if you're concerned?

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.159
Seems to me that havin' a husband's
a little bit like goin' to church.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.599
You either believe in something or you don't.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.399
And if you don't, then why go at all?

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.399
But if you do, then you've no cause
to keep asking for proof.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.319
And do you...believe?

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.319
Most ofthe time.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.039
Why don't you smile, Mama?

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.719
Well, smiling makes lines upon the face,
my love.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.679
See?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.199
And lines make us look older.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:39.719
So I must smile less.
Not in public, but here, at home.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.679
But when you see me not smiling,
you mustn't think I'm sad or displeased with you,

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.759
only that I'm trying to spare my face.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.239
It's important for a lady to look her best.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.399
- Why?
- You'll understand when you're older.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.079
Seven months has seemed a lifetime.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.159
Did my letters not satisfy you?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.399
They evoked pleasure and pain
in equal measure.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.159
Forgive me, I'm a little at sea.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.759
All I know for certain is I'm my own mistress,
yet no freer to follow my heart.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:04.479
But I'm here, and you're here...
perhaps that's all that matters.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.279
I met your Captain Poldark again.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.119
He told me.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.799
Would you be jealous
if I said I admired him greatly?

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.319
I admire him myself.
He's an exceptional man and a dear friend.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.439
I only wish his circumstances were happier.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.839
Is his cousin's pretty widow the "circumstance",
or is it some other matter?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.559
A financial matter.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.199
And his wife?
She seems to be universally adored.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.359
Is she the sort ofwoman that all men desire
except her husband?

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.919
It so ofen happens.
No great incentive for marriage.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.959
Don't you think I'd be ill-advised to try it?

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.239
Not if you choose the right man.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.239
Shall I choose a miracle worker,

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.239
who now has an adoring Rosina and
a crowd of sickly miners battering his door?

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.999
There can't be many physicians of your calibre
who give all their energies to help the poor.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.239
How do you live?

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.159
On an income of£40 a year from the two mines,
plus whatever my patients can spare me.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.879
I agree it's very little.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.639
Could you not set up in Oxford or Bath,
work among people of your own kind?

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.919
Charity is a noble impulse,
but should it not begin at home?

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.559
Even in Bath or Oxford, the poor will always
be in greater need of attention than the rich.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.559
Besides, I've no wish to become a society pet.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.679
Is that what you think I am?

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.919
No, Caroline.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.999
I would never suggest that,
or wish you to think that I'm...

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.199
The most noble of men,
and I the most vacuous ofwomen?

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.479
Would you have me pretend
to be other than I am?

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.879
I would have you believe
that you're better than you think.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.919
Race me!

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.439
Mark Daniel?

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.479
'Twould be too risky, I believe,
for him to return to England.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.879
Have you asked my men for news of him?

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:41.119
I thought I'd come to you first.
Besides, I'm not sure who to trust.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.919
The informer who answers to Vercoe
might also report to McNeil.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.079
McNeil claims convalescence,
not the trade, has brought him here.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.759
- Do you believe him?
- Not a jot.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.759
Our trusted band grows smaller.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.159
I removed Vigus.
Now I think to replace Jacka Hoblyn.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.479
Why do you suspect him?

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.359
I suspect everyone. 'Tis the safest way.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.799
I think you're mistook.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.119
Jacka's a surly fellow,
but I doubt he'd betray his friends.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:17.479
- Any man'll betray his friends ifthe price is right.
- As Ted knows to his cost.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.759
Ted! How are you?
Have you recovered from your sentence?

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.999
Three months' hard labour
do feel like three years.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.279
And still I'm no closer
to knowin' who betrayed me.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.559
But to Mark Daniel.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.879
I could put the word out,
get a letter to him.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.519
I'd be very grateful.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.279
And in exchange?

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.839
Yes?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.959
One drawback to your cove.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.559
You've always insisted, haven't you,
that all must be done in a single night?

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.159
Don't blame you. But 'tis deuced awkward.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.919
Ifwe could store some ofthe goods
two or three days...

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.439
Ten men do in three nights what 30 do in one.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.879
Less chance for the informer.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.199
Bring the cargo ashore and hide it,
if you catch my drift.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:15.479
We'd be willing to make
a small extra payment for the inconvenience.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.279
A goodwill gesture, so to speak.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.519
How much of a gesture?

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.519
A secret cache? On our land?

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.079
To store goods during a run
so they can be carried away at leisure.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.839
Or found by the gaugers,
and you carried away in chains!

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.799
I'll be in chains regardless soon enough.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.359
Dislike it, Ross.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.919
If I go to prison for debt,
this will mean more money coming in.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.559
The quicker the debt is paid,
the quicker I'm out again.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.679
Unless goods be found in our house,
in which case you'll serve longer!

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.879
The cache will be built in the library
and can be done in one night.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.639
Four or five men to dig it,
six or eight to use it thereafter.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.319
And the informer?

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.399
Trencrom will hand-pick his men.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.719
And in return?

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.519
25 guineas per cargo,
and a promise to find Mark Daniel.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.879
- How will that help?
- He's our last chance offinding copper,

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.199
of making the mine pay.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.479
If Grace fails, how will I repay the Warleggans?

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.639
Why can you not appeal to your friends?

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.599
Ray Penvenen,
Horace Treneglos, even Trencrom?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.559
Would they not put up the money
to save you from bankruptcy?

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.359
- The sum is too great.
- You mean your pride is!

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.919
No one of sense, however much a friend,
would loan money to a man with a failing mine,

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.159
for the simple reason
that they would never get it back.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:55.199
But if I could demonstrate that the mine might
prosper, I could borrow against its better days.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.199
Until we find Mark Daniel.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.399
- Do I have your consent?
- You dare to ask me that?

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:08.439
Knowin' very well you do exactly
what you please, with or without my say?

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.399
Were you ever involved
in Ross Poldark's copper smelting venture?

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.159
I made a minor investment.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.359
It was an ill-conceived enterprise.
Everyone lost money.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.879
Except the Warleggans.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.479
Why do you ask?

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.919
I believe Ross Poldark has some debt
from that time.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.639
The Warleggans acquired it
and are pressing for bankruptcy.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.399
You're very well informed.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.399
Less than I'd like to be.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.679
No doubt Dr Enys could enlighten you further.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.119
I shall go to Truro tomorrow.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.159
It's a poor place to shop
but I need new buckles for my shoes.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.879
- You are your own mistress now, Caroline.
- So I am.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:08.959
Though...I think you should not allow
a natural pleasure in your new freedom

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.679
to override the requirements of good conduct.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:21.879
To ride far and unattended in the company
of a young man of eligible years

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.159
is to invite comment of an unsavoury nature.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.279
No doubt it was innocently done,

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:35.839
but it is neither fair to me,
who may seem to countenance it,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.439
or to the young man himself, who may derive
from it ambitions beyond his proper sphere.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.879
Thank you for your concern, Uncle.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.679
If my conduct so bothers you,

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.999
would it not be better
for me to quit this house and live elsewhere?

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.999
That would be an excellent solution, were it not
for the great affection we hold for each other.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.399
Uncle Ray is becoming cross with me, Horace.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.239
There will shortly be angry words
which we shall both regret.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.919
Don't you think
we had better change the subject?

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.919
At what hour tomorrow
shall you require the carriage?

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.679
At nine.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.559
Thank you, Uncle.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:30.599
"Dear Dr Enys, I should be obliged
if you would attend on me tomorrow morning

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.199
between ten-thirty and eleven...

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.559
and oblige Ray Penvenen."

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.239
My dears, you do recall
that I'm to return home today?

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.879
Fiddlesticks! 'Tis nearly Christmas.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.799
A woman should be with her family at such time.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.559
My husband would agree with you.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.479
Ah! Men. They have business to attend to.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.399
I doubt he's even noticed you're gone.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.759
His letters suggest otherwise.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.359
In any case, I've missed him a great deal,

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.039
and have every intention
of making up for lost time.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.799
(Agatha coughs and splutters)

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.959
And you?

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.359
I have an invitation to Nampara.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.399
- Shall you accept?
- Geoffrey Charles is eager.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.039
Are you?

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.679
I think it may do me good
to have some varied company.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.599
- These guests?
- Are specifically chosen for their use to us,

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.239
in business, in society, in terms ofthe future.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.599
Arabella Trevelyan, the Honourable
Maria Penrose, Eliza Courtney-Prowse?

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.639
- These girls must be all of 17!
- And prime breeding stock.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.799
You may examine their teeth if you choose.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.879
I think I'll ride to Trenwith.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.679
When will you call in the loans on that estate?

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.479
What's to be gained
by staying in the good books

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.719
of a poverty-stricken widow in her late 20s?

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.999
I could alleviate her poverty if I chose,
but I choose to let her feel it.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.279
She has made her bed
and now she must lie in it.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.319
(Demelza grunts)

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.519
Agh.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.599
Oh, Judas!

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.359
- Do 'ee read my fortune?
- Aye, maid.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:40.239
It do tell me, with hands like these,
Demelza Poldark be no lady!

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.399
This kindling is damp.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.879
- Has it been seasoned?
- I've no idea.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.399
Of course not.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.359
I'm glad to see you allow yourself some luxuries.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.639
Oh...no. It is a present for Geoffrey Charles,

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.679
from George.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.399
Oh, has he been here?

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.799
I had to admit him, Ross.
He's my chief creditor.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.839
- And his views on your debts?
- Very generous. They always have been.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.679
He offered to waive the interest indefinitely.
Of course I could not accept.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.239
My quarrel with George is not your quarrel.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.759
If he wants to win your approval, let him.
You don't have to like him.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.919
- (Elizabeth exhales)
- You're shivering.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.799
I wish I could help you.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.919
For my own sake, I can bear it.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.519
But for my son, for his future...

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.239
When Francis came into his estate,
there was money to live on,

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.919
comfort, dignity.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.559
It breaks my heart to think that
Geoffrey Charles will have so little to his name.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.399
It breaks my heart too.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.599
There's nothing to be done, is there?

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.919
My remaining shares in Wheal Leisure.
What would you say is their worth?

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.759
Upwards of£600.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.759
Sell them.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.799
You wish to devote the money to Wheal Grace?

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.519
No.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.999
To a special purpose.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.719
Francis's widow and family are in dire need.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.399
More so than yours?

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.959
Two years ago, Francis sank his last £600
into Wheal Grace.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.199
I want Elizabeth Poldark to have it back.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.519
- Will she accept?
- Of course not,

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.519
which is why I need your help.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.959
When my shares in Wheal Leisure are sold,

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.119
you'll make an offer
for Geoffrey Charles's holding in Wheal Grace,

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.239
on behalf of an anonymous client
whom you represent.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.159
Elizabeth will accept,
and the money can be transferred to her.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.199
So do I understand you aright?

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:08.279
You are offering £600 for a half share
in a mine which is about to close,

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:14.919
when you owe George Warleggan, the man
who will happily see you in debtors' prison,

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.839
- £1 ,400?
- Correct.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.959
As your banker and friend,
I must advise against.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.479
You cannot afford it. And you have
your own wife and child to care for.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.359
Would it not seem as ifyou value
your cousin-in-law's comfort ahead of hers?

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.239
It might, if I chose to tell her, which I do not.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.919
I am here. Francis is not.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.439
Demelza has resources
which Elizabeth does not.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.999
She's a miner's daughter.
She has learnt to survive.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.839
Elizabeth is a gentlewoman.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.199
And you are a madman.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.919
A madman who can now order his life
with a clear conscience.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.879
My niece is in Truro.
I have taken the opportunity to summon you.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.679
I imagine you've some idea why?

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.639
I don't think it's for me to speculate, sir.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.519
I might wish you'd shown such delicacy
in all your dealings.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.319
I'm sorry you think I have not.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.959
I refer to your friendship with my niece.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.039
In what way do you consider that offensive?

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.639
Oh, come, sir. You cannot be ignorant
ofthe ways ofthe world.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.879
As for a serious attachment...

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.879
..with a young man of your station...

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.759
- I am a gentleman, sir.
- And she is an heiress!

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:12.159
Much too important a person to be entangled
with a penniless country doctor like yourself.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.879
Is that not for her to decide?

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.399
Caroline must marry with my consent,

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.679
otherwise she will not inherit a penny.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:26.919
She has been brought up
in the greatest possible luxury.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.679
Do you suppose that she'll sacrifice that
for the little you have to offer?

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.479
She has given me cause to suppose so.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.159
Or you may think
she has a private fortune of her own.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.439
- I neither know nor care what she has.
- £6,000. £6,000.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.439
All you'd get if you married her.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.839
Until now,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.719
I've suffered your comments with a due
degree of civility, but there are limits, sir.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.439
God knows I've never given you cause
to suppose me a fortune hunter,

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.679
and if you imagine that no man without an eye to
her inheritance could fall in love with your niece,

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.799
then you greatly underrate her charms
and insult us both.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.039
Well, I hope I have made my views clear.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.919
And in doing so you have given me hope.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.439
Caroline's fortune is less than I thought.
I'm glad of it.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.359
A penniless doctor could wed such a fortune
yet not be eclipsed by it.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.679
You will leave this house now, sir,
and you'll never return.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.759
You will cease all communication with my niece.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.079
Caroline is of age, sir.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.479
Your control may be exercised
within these walls, but not beyond.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:39.839
I see I have gravely mistaken your character,
Dr Enys.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.879
But at least now we understand each other.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.479
Oh, yes, sir.

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.959
Now we understand each other.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.759
London is so diverting. I may well
take a house for the season next year.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.159
May I hope to be honoured
by a visit from yourself?

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.799
I'd be delighted, sir, and I'd like to think
Elizabeth could be persuaded.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.639
Once she's out of mourning?

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.359
But I dare not hope for it. She's been closeted
away at Trenwith for so long.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:22.759
Yet society deserves to see more
of its rarest treasures, yourself included.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.119
Oh!
(Laughs)

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.479
Goodbye, little man.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.519
Look after your mama this Christmas.
It's what your papa would wish.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.319
You may think me interfering,
but I urge you

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.879
to let Ross and Demelza
keep this Christmas to themselves.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.199
- But...
- For your sake as well as theirs.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.239
Nothing will happen till nightfall.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.479
- Well, that do make all the difference!
- Demelza...

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.519
What can I do?
I can't beg for money. I can't earn it.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.919
I can't dig for it. I can't tell him not to dig.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.159
What use am I?

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.479
He should've wed someone
like Caroline Penvenen.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.399
I've know'd Cap'n Ross since he were a whelp.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.319
Since his mother died.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:56.279
She was a good soul, an' a wise,
an' I know what she'd say.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.039
- What?
- That her lad had met his match.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.119
Mebbe that was true once, but now...

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.119
- ..now I'm his torment.
- And she'd say, serve him right.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.959
I could crown him.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.159
An' he scarcely knows I'm there.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.719
(Knocking)

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.759
Prudie! Don't answer it!

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.319
Oh! Charlie! I did fear it might be the gaugers.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.999
Why would they suspect
a gentleman's house, ma'am?

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.439
I come with a message for Cap'n Ross.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.159
Wait here. I'll fetch him.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.479
Ross? There's a visitor.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.399
Charlie!

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.919
What is it?

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.439
Mr Trencrom say if 'ee wish to write a letter
to Mark Daniel in France, do so.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.519
I'll see it gets aboard when The One & All sails.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:00.239
Ross! I'm so glad you're here.
I want to know what I must do.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.559
From Pascoe?

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.679
An offer has been made
for Geoffrey Charles's share ofWheal Grace.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.239
It's not the Warleggans.
I've already ascertained that.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.039
Is it not astonishing?

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.799
It's a good price.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.879
But that someone should offer as much
for his share as Francis first put into it?

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.239
Has there been some new discovery of ore?

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.759
Far from it.
Everyone knows we must close soon.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.239
"The prospective buyer is a gentleman
who wishes to remain nameless

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.839
but who has your son's best interest at heart."

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.319
Remarkable.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.759
What do you advise?
Should I consider the offer?

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.919
Consider? You should accept it without delay.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:44.639
Our situation here... The money
would make all the difference. But for you?

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.519
Are you sure it won't compromise you?
Your new partner, a stranger?

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.559
I know you think it best for us, but I'd hate to
think I was taking advantage of our friendship.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:59.479
Elizabeth, you must sell.
This will enormously ease your situation.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.639
I'm only grateful for your hesitation,
and your loyalty all these months.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.879
Loyalty's not all on one side, Ross,
nor ever has been.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:15.239
I regret I must decline your invitation
for Christmas.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.839
I believe Francis would want me
to spend it in his house.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.839
And I regret that circumstances are such
that I cannot take care of you as I might wish.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.239
We both regret that, Ross.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.279
You've had time to consider your position?

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.319
I have.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.199
See, Caroline, you... you must understand

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.799
that though I might tolerate the young man
on a professional basis,

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:17.239
I cannot permit him to have sight of you again
afer his impudent pretensions to your hand.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.919
I misunderstood his attentions, Uncle.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.759
Now that I apprehend them,
I will know how to behave in future.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.519
Caroline.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.879
(Horse whinnies)

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.599
You're an accomplished rider, Dr Enys.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.879
Clearly such talents would be wasted in city life.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.039
I have other talents which would not.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.919
But you can't bear the thought of Bath.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.559
And you can't bear the thought of marriage.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.639
To a man oftalent, anything is possible.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:26.039
Without you, nothing is possible.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.479
Hup, hup!

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.079
War now seems inevitable.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.319
Merry Christmas, Ross.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.719
Pitt's called out the military.
The French are in Antwerp.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.479
Gravy?

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.519
What?

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.359
Oh...yes...thank you.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.079
I invited Dwight to join us.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.279
Oh?

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.399
- He declined.
- Probablyjust as well.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.879
Would have meant two mouthfuls apiece
as opposed to three.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:24.399
- I expect he's meeting Caroline.
- I expect he is.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.919
From Mr Trencrom.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.159
(Baby gurgles)

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.759
Mark Daniel.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.599
Yes?

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.839
Apparently he's disappeared
from the face ofthe earth.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.559
Oh.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.559
Leastways now we know.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.759
Yes. Now we know our last hope is gone.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.079
I wish it could be more, my darling.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.879
Perhaps next Christmas.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.199
Rose-water? Do I require a fumigant?

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.199
- No, Aunt, but...
- Francis always knew what I liked.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.399
Brandywine, port and Canary.
Preferably all three.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.719
Oh, how charming!

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.079
- Did you make it yourself?
- Yes, Mama.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.359
Just the thing for guarding the fire
and avoiding society!

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.359
Then we'll all need one.
Get your needles out, Elizabeth.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.319
Mr George Warleggan.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.079
My compliments ofthe season, dear ladies.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.559
Sit by me, child.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.839
Beware that man's pitchfork and his tail.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.359
I was passing and wondered

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.959
if I might beg the favour
of Elizabeth's company for a few hours?

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.359
We have a small gathering at Cardew.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.199
Only if she can be spared, of course.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.999
I fear I cannot.

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.159
We intend to keep Christmas quietly,
just among ourselves.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:04.719
Elizabeth, dear, allow me to assist you
in choosing a suitable gown.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.839
(Lively strings play)

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.359
- I wanted to ask your advice.
- Yes?

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.039
As Geoffrey Charles's godfather,
I will of course be responsible

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.919
for the cost of his education
until he completes university.

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:48.839
- That's too generous. I cannot allow...
- I was not asking your permission, Elizabeth.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.919
Only your opinion
as to whether you favour Oxford or Cambridge.

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.879
But this is beyond anything, George.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:03.239
- I don't know what to say.
- Then may I leave you to ponder,

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.559
while I fulfil my obligations to Miss Trevelyan?

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:13.919
I believe you know Sir John, Lord Devoran,
MrAlfred Barbary, my Uncle Cary.

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.639
Gentlemen.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.679
Charmed, I'm sure.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.679
I suspect it won't be long,
till we see a Mistress George Warleggan.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.439
Odds on it's the Penrose girl.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.039
He wouldn't be satisfied
with anything less than an honourable.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.359
Nor should he be!

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.319
I've discussed it with Pascoe.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.359
We wait until late in the day
to tell Cary I cannot pay him.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.199
Then there's a chance they won't come
and arrest me till tomorrow.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:53.479
So we shall have one final night
at home together.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.199
- Where are you going?
- With you.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:00.399
If you think you're to play the hero
and face this alone, you're greatly mistook.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.679
Mistress Poldark! This is a surprise.

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:28.639
- Something to fortify you?
- Thank you, I will. I fear I'll need it.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.999
As I told you, the Warleggans
declined to extend the loan.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.799
Thank you.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.279
'Tis my suspicion they care nothing
for the money.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.479
What they want is the man.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.279
And here he is.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:51.159
And yet I think perhaps...
they may be disappointed.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:52.839
How?

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.479
- I recently received a visit...
- From?

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:01.119
A person who wishes to remain nameless.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.359
- Harris Pascoe?
- Miss Penvenen.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:11.199
The proposal I'm instructed to make is this:

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:15.319
to purchase your debt, in full,

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:22.039
and arrange a new promissory note
at a considerably lower rate of interest.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.959
I don't understand.
How could anyone consider that an investment?

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:31.359
The person concerned regards it
as a mark offaith in your prospects and integrity.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:38.039
Ifyou accept,
the full £1 ,400 will instantly be forthcoming

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.719
and you may take it to the Warleggans
this very hour.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.879
But who is this person?
Who would do such a thing?

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.439
- Is it you, Harris?
- It is not.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.919
I need your assurance
that no one else will learn ofthis arrangement.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.759
Of course.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:54.879
- But surely your uncle...
- Your absolute assurance. Can you give it?

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.919
Nor am I at liberty to disclose their name.

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.439
- It was their express condition.
- Is it someone we know?

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.839
- Is it Trencrom?
- Sir Hugh?

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.759
The money is available
the moment you sign the new promissory note.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.999
- Is it Horace Treneglos?
- I cannot tell you anything more.

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:17.159
But you, knowin' this person,
do advise us to accept?

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:26.319
But I, knowing this person,
do advise you to accept.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.719
Should we offer him a glass, do you think?

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.319
It may be the last good port he has for a while.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.839
Why not? We are gentlemen, after all.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.999
(Chuckles drily)

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.679
This way, please, sir.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.559
Good day to you both.
You know my wife, Demelza.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.039
Good day to you, ma'am.
Delighted you can join us.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.079
May I offer you some refreshment?

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:05.879
'Tis most kind ofyou, sir,
but I fear it would not be fitting.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.159
I regret to say I'm unable
to give you the satisfaction...

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.599
Most unfortunate.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.999
..of visiting me in prison.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.679
You will have to make do with this.

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.559
- What is this foolery?
- Repayment in full,

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.439
with interest.

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.759
We wish you both
the compliments ofthe season.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.359
How?

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.319
How has he managed this?

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.599
You told me he had no allies, no friends.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.159
I was evidently wrong.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.399
We will bring him down!

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:56.879
If it takes ten years,
we will see him in the gutter, and his slut.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.559
- We will make it our mission to...
- Compose yourself, Uncle.

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.079
Does half of Cornwall
need to hear ofthis small setback?

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.919
Small? You call it small?

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.039
In the grand scheme ofthings, it is small.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.759
And there are other ways to punish him,
which do not involve money.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.879
From George.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.839
- Prudie?
- Judas!

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:44.519
What's this? A secret cache?

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.239
'Twas the maid's notion, sir.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:50.159
She bid us not to tell 'ee.
'Tis against 'ee goin' to prison.

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.679
What else were you not to tell me?

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:56.399
Do 'ee need a list of all the things she do
to keep us safe and fed an' warm an' fitty?

You're right.
I barely notice half ofwhat she does.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:40.519
Of late, I've barely noticed her at all.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:56.039
I bought a few things
while you were at the chandler's.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.239
You shouldn't have.

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.199
We've so little to spare.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:04.759
Well, you had nothing for Christmas,
not even my attention.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.799
I need no gifts, Ross.

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.079
'Tis enough if you still care for me.

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.679
Do you doubt it?

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.799
I've begun to.

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:23.359
At least, not your liking,

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.079
but...mebbe your longing.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.439
You think I no longer love you?

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.479
Not in that way.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.919
Open your present.

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.839
(Exhales)

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.159
What is it? Do you not like them?

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.519
They're too fine. Where would I wear them?

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.359
- Will they suit you?
- I cannot tell.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.519
Let me see.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.759
If you like.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.919
So you are not to be rid of me, my love.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.399
So I am not to be rid of you, my love.
