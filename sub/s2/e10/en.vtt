WEBVTT

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.079
(Mine bell clangs)

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.319
Can scarce sleep at night, for dreaming
ofthe lode and wanting to get back to her.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.119
'Tis a miracle. A mine that do actually pay.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.239
And notjust pay. Yields riches.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.759
- Your gamble has paid off.
- Our gamble.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.159
There are soldiers in the village
looking for men to enlist.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.919
And we thought war couldn't touch us here.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.879
(Horse whinnies, musket fire)

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.039
(Soldiers cry out)

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.719
(Cannons rumble)

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.919
He plays beautifully by himself.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.079
Yet it's a lonely thing...

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.079
..to be an only child.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.559
Oh... must it go?

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.959
I think Geoffrey Charles will miss it.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.159
But my dear,
this is where I hoped that my gift to you...

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.879
- Which?
- A portrait of us both.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.159
Painted by the celebrated John Opie.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.799
You spoil me.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.359
Hm.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.559
(Knocks)

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.159
Would you excuse me, my dear?

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.679
How long will Uncle George stay, Mama?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.519
Oh, sweetheart.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.159
Uncle George lives here now.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.599
You must think of him as your new papa.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.039
- What be going on here?
- Hop it!

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.839
- This be private land.
- Since when?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.479
Since Mr Warleggan be master here.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.039
He can't do that. This is open land.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.399
- No longer!
- Aargh!

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.919
- (Woman shrieks)
- Mr Warleggan will have 'ee hanged

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.679
if he sees thee here again.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.279
Is...is that wise?

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.559
A man who owns land
has the right to enclose it.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.919
But... to use force needlessly
is to court enemies.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.959
Are you becoming squeamish?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.119
I merely question the virtue of
provoking one's neighbours.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.279
Great or small.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.839
Are you sure it was on Warleggan orders?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.359
Look at Jory, look at Dan.
Do you not recognise the handiwork?

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.519
You also tried to cross at Trenwith Land?

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.239
Warleggan thinks he can do as he please.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.479
- He needs reining in.
MAN: Hear, hear.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.719
Well, who's to do it?
The man owns halfthe county.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.599
Them Frenchies have the right idea,
eh, Dr Enys.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.639
I used to think so.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.199
What began as a just cause
has since become a bloodbath.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.959
'Twill happen here soon enough.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.519
- (Laughter)
- Mark my words.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.559
Demelza!

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.079
Give me your hand.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.599
Cast your mind back a 12 month.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.679
How many times did we think all was lost?

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.759
You'd surely not wish to be back there again?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.279
(Coins jingle and clatter)

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.279
Would I not, Ross?

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.439
(Ticking)

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.199
- Drink?
- Regularly.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.399
Wine?

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.559
Canary.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.599
Appetite?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.559
Voracious.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.679
Urine?

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.719
Unusually sweet.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.279
So Doctor Choake informs me.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.679
- And his diagnosis?
- Oh.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.199
The fever then the gout.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.359
Wasting disease. Tuberculosis infection.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.879
You anything to add?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.639
Only that I believe him to be utterly mistaken.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.319
It is the sugar sickness.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.599
The symptoms are unmistakable.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.719
- What must I do?
- Give up most ofthe things you eat and drink.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.759
Wine especially.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.919
And that'll cure me, will it?

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.079
No. But it may prolong your life.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.159
Will my life be worth living?
It hardly sounds like it.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.319
- Doctor Enys?
- Hm?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.759
You and I did not part as friends.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.359
So I'm all the more
obliged to you for coming.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.319
But I feel it only fair to tell you that...

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.599
Caroline will shortly be engaged
to Lord Coniston...

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.159
..eldest son of Earl Windermere.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.159
I congratulate Miss Penvenen.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.159
I do hope this information
will not now distress you.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.999
Not in the least, sir.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.559
I bid you good day.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.439
Are you quite clear, Dr Enys,
what you are signing up for?

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.239
The duration ofthe war? Which you assure me
will be long, desperate and bloody.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.839
I may not return to these shores for years.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.999
Or indeed, at all.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.639
Where do I sign?

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.159
(Grunts)

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.399
I wonder, is it wise to seek more confrontation?

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.559
Is there or is there not some doubt
over the legality ofthis arrangement?

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.079
Ah, my dear. The sale of Geoffrey Charles's
shares in Wheal Grace.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.079
We fear it might have been fraudulent.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.239
Do you recall Ross mentioning
any new shareholders?

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.759
You must know I have had no dealings
with Ross since before our marriage.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.239
Of course, my dear. Do not distress yourself.
Leave me to deal with the matter.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.879
Dear Poldark...

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.799
as you are a trustee of Francis's estate,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.239
perhaps you might shed light
on certain recent transactions

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.599
which appear troubling.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.639
Dear  Warleggan, as you are not
a trustee of Francis's estate,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.559
I do not considerthe business
in any way concerns you.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.439
Dear Poldark, it may have escaped your notice
that Elizabeth and I are now married.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.479
In attending to Francis's estate,
I am merely trying to take the burden off her.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.039
She has been unwell
and would prefer to meet you at Trenwith

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.479
if you could trouble yourselfto attend.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.159
(Door unbolted and opens)

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.599
These are pleasant times, Nephew.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.999
No peasant safe from assault?

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.119
Or is thatjust our house?

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.519
You need not remain here, Aunt.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.999
Come and live at Nampara.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.319
And let that upstart win?

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.879
(Scoffs)

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.639
We need not take much of your time, provided
you can supply sufficient explanation.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.079
Where's Elizabeth?

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.039
Resting.
We can complete the business without her.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.279
I think not. She is co-trustee in his estate.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.799
I shall do nothing without her presence.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:25.639
Well, she has signed a power of attorney
so that I may act on her behalf.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.119
At her request.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.239
Since she wants nothing more to do with you.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.919
- Shall we get on?
- Hm.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.279
The half share in Wheal Grace,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.839
held on behalf of Mrs Warleggan's son,
Geoffrey Charles,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.599
- disposed of at the beginning ofthe year.
- What of it?

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.999
We're not satisfied
that the transaction was legal.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.799
It was legal.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.079
Mrs Poldar...

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:13.679
Mrs Warleggan received £600 on behalf
of her son for a half share in a worthless mine.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.439
And who was so foolish as to pay her that sum?

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.439
I was.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.279
In January, Elizabeth was in dire straits.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.239
Having persuaded Francis
to sink his last £600 into the mine,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.959
I felt duty bound to give it back to Elizabeth.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.919
Knowing she would not accept
the money as a gif,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.639
I devised a strategy to do so
without her knowing.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.239
GEORGE:
But circumstances have since changed.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.879
- What you took from Elizabeth and her son...
- Purchased.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.719
..is now worth more than what you gave for it.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.359
Should you now not return the half share
ofthis successful mine

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.839
into the custody ofthe child's trustees?

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.359
In other words...you.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.559
As his adopted father,
naturally I would manage his affairs.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.999
Last January, had the Wheal Grace stock
come on to the market,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.679
it would not have fetched £10.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.559
The mine was finished.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.759
We kept her going through winter.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.399
And with our bare hands
we reopened her after a catastrophic rock fall.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.799
We risked everything we had, George.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.319
And against all odds, we struck tin.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.599
So now, I deem the profit mine...

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.639
..not Elizabeth's.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.879
Not Geoffrey Charles's.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.199
And most especially not yours.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.839
So unless you have anything else to add...

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.599
Only that you may wish to consider
how poorly this reflects on you.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.279
A man who cheats his young ward.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.879
Up to now, I have offered no violence.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.639
But if you persist...

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.559
You would not dare lay a finger on me.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.279
Because your army of servants will protect you?

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.679
Go back to your scullery maid.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.999
Kemp! Harry! Triggs! In here now!

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.279
Get this man out of my house!

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.799
Your house? Your house?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.959
This is Geoffrey Charles's house!

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.879
I can walk. I can walk!

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.839
JEREMY: Aaaah!
- Good...

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.359
A mild colic. I'll mix him a sedative.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.959
- Come to old Prudie, Master Jeremy.
- Go on, then.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.119
See what she have for you now.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.679
- You'll stay until Ross returns?
- Of course.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.839
I have some news.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.399
I've applied for a post
as a surgeon in the Navy.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.439
I expect to leave any day.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.199
- Oh, but, Dwight...
- I must gain more experience.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.359
And the war will surely supply that.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.479
And besides, I've had news of Caroline.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.799
- She's to be married.
- To a Lord Coniston.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.359
- I'm that sorry.
- I'm not.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.959
It was the spur I needed to put her behind me.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.559
But you did love her.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.119
We would never have been happy.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.279
We're too dissimilar.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.239
Judas. What happened?

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.039
It's a scratch.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.799
Nothing compared to what I gave Ross.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.039
I hope he will have learnt his lesson.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.599
Are you angry?

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.759
Little boys fighting?

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.359
- He was offensive.
- (Scoffss)

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.519
About someone other than myself.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.519
I can scarce believe we're losing Dwight.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.799
Nor I.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.599
It makes me wonder if I should go.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.319
Why? Cos your dearest friend
is running away, so must you?

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.079
Because I'm a soldier.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.799
And if my regiment requires me...

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.399
Obviously the thought of leaving you
and Jeremy...

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.039
It wouldn't be the first time
you've considered such a thing.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.119
How was Elizabeth?

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.919
She avoided me.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.639
- And you've avoided her.
- What would you have me do?

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.119
I'd have you be honest, Ross.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.439
To her. To me. To yourself.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.479
Am I not honest?

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.639
Where am I not honest now?

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.679
Go to war, Ross. Play soldiers.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.439
Or stay home and save all of Cornwall.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.519
What it is to be married to such a great man.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.119
Letter come.
And Mr Ross d'ride to Truro.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.959
(Clears throat) There. You hold that.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.159
My dear  Demelza, as my time draws near ,

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.639
I am both excited and afeared
in equal measure.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.439
And with Andrew away at sea, I begin to miss
my Nampara cousins most dreadfully.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.999
How I wish I had your  strength
to see me through.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.239
How fortunate you are
to have Ross always at your  side.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.239
Yes, how fortunate.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:30.679
Rejoin your regiment? Just as your mine
begins to prosper and your family is secure?

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.599
It's because we're secure
that I'd consider going.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.319
Obviously, I'd need to put
my affairs in order first.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:43.399
Beginning with George. He's contesting the sale
of my nephew's shares in Wheal Grace.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.359
The deal was entirely legal.
But that may not deter him.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:52.759
He has the funds to finance a lawsuit
and to drag it out for years.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.799
I've had my fill of court.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.839
But what could be his purpose?

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.919
To get his hands on Grace the way
he did Leisure. Especially now she prospers.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.199
Which reminds me.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.519
- My mystery benefactor.
- Yes?

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.559
I wish to repay him.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.839
So tell me his name.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.159
- You recall the loan was given in confidence.
- Oh, come, Harris.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.879
I cannot go away to war without thanking him
in person. So who is he?

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.759
Well, as to that...

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.239
I don't recall ever mentioning a "he"... at all.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.679
Caroline Penvenen?

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.359
Dwight must have told her about our business.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.319
Is that not astonishing?

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.599
I dare say she's taken a fancy to you.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.399
I'm a married man.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.079
- And that would make all the difference?
- Oh, Demelza.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.679
It was one night.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.159
How long will it take you to forgive me?

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.319
I don't know, Ross.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.959
How long would it take you to forgive me?

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.999
That's hardly the same. You would never do
a thing which required my forgiveness.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.479
Are you sure?

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.279
When?

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:23.119
Werry House. After the ball,
Captain McNeil came to my room.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.279
How could he dare?

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.479
Because I invited him.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.719
After your antics with Elizabeth,
I decided I might have a turn myself.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.759
A turn?

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.279
- How far did you...?
- Oh, kisses, caresses.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.319
- And then I sent him away.
- Good God, Demelza. Was that not enough?

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.119
I tell you, I do not admire you for this.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.199
It does you no credit. Nor me neither.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.079
What credit did your night with Elizabeth do me?

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.239
- That's entirely different.
- How is it different?

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.279
I take no pride in my visit to her.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.439
It was the outcome of a devotion
which, on my side, lasted ten years!

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.199
Not some tawdry little passion
worked up over a glass of port

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.959
with some opportunist soldier
who took what was on offer.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.719
That is precisely not what was on offer.
I did not permit him.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.879
How do I know what you permitted?

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.159
You're right, Ross.
How do you know?

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.319
Ifyou trust me not and I trust you not,
then what is the point in this marriage at all?

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.319
I entirely agree.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.959
What is the point?

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.999
DEMELZA: Right, let's get going.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.359
JUD: At this time of night?

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.959
Welcome, ma'am. My father is at sea
so has asked me to be here in his stead.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.639
- We expect the confinement any day.
- Oh, Verity!

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.039
This is a turnabout.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.279
Andrew insisted I was not to be left unattended,
but that she should be the one to come.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.359
Ross? I came to tell you...

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.839
Ross?

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.679
- You surely don't intend...?
- Am I not a soldier?

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.479
With a family, a prosperous mine, a settled life.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.479
But perhaps that's the problem.
You're so blessed you've nothing to fight for.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.599
What does Demelza say?

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.199
- Does she even know?
- She will know soon enough.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.919
Whenever she returns.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.719
Dwight... (Clears his throat)

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.559
..I must tell you...
my mysterious benefactor...

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.039
..is Caroline.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.399
How? Why would she...?

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.239
I can only apologise if I spoke too freely
ofyour business affairs.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.879
I can only express my gratitude that you did.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.839
I owe you both more than I can say.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.119
Together you saved me and in return...

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.159
I can assure you, I have no regrets.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.119
And nor, it appears, does Caroline.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.039
And now we may be brothers in arms.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.959
My...er...my posting is through.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.399
HMS Travail. I leave for Plymouth tomorrow.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.999
God speed.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.479
And good luck.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.799
She's growing used to me.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.679
Am I not the luckiest ofwomen?

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.839
- The most deserving.
- And you?

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.479
Lord knows what I deserve.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.519
How is Ross?

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.399
At war with himself.
And the idea of George at Trenwith.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.439
I too struggle with the idea of my family home
in the hands of a Warleggan.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.839
But Elizabeth has made her choice.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.999
(Gasps in pain)

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.439
It's nothing. It's like cramp.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.639
It's been happening since last night.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.919
It may not be nothing.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.839
(Urges on horses)

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.239
♪ Some say the devil's dead...

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.199
♪ An' buried in Fowey harbour

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.239
♪ Some say he'm alive again

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.479
♪ An' wedded to a barber...

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.079
- Stand and deliver!
- (Screams)

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.519
(Continues screaming)

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.239
(Chuckles)

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.399
Captain Poldark. What a treat.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.279
Yet I see no flags out for your visit.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.439
They put the flags out when I leave!

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.719
Tell me all the news of Cornwall.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.719
My dear Elizabeth, this news has made me
the happiest of men.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.079
- So, what brings you to London?
- I need to see justice done.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.839
My mine has begun to prosper.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.319
It was your loan which enabled me
to keep it open till we struck tin.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.679
- My loan?
- There's no point denying it.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.599
So now, you stand accused ofwilfully saving

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.919
three people from the worst disaster
bankruptcy can bring.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.999
- And what is my sentence?
- To bear the brunt of my eternal gratitude.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.999
And to shortly take receipt of repayment in full.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.519
So, instead ofthanking me,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.039
you should be congratulating me
on my shrewd business sense.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.959
I believe congratulations of another sort are due.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.199
Your engagement to Lord Coniston.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.839
Arthur has made me several offers of marriage
which I have so far declined.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.039
May I ask why?

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.599
The usual capriciousness of my sex.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.679
And, presumably, you do not love him.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.719
As you say, I do not love him.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.559
In fact, it's probable you still love Dwight Enys.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.879
Since you left, he has been unable to settle.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.919
Oh, and he has no idea I'm here.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.559
And had he known,
he would certainly have forbidden me.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.239
But I thought you should know that
he has joined the Navy.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.399
(Man plays a jig on his fiddle)

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.199
(Ribald laughter)

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.279
(Lively chatter)

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.959
- Doctor Enys, welcome to the Navy.
- Thank you.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.759
Let me get you a drink.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.719
Douglas?

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.119
- Why have you come here?
- To ask you why you left Cornwall.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.919
And why you refused Dwight a second chance

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.319
after he explained what happened
the night ofthe ambush.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:06.599
Did you not see him?
In the weeks before we were due to elope?

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.759
He behaved as if he were contemplating
something shameful.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:17.239
Deserting his beloved patients in the
middle ofthe night for the fleshpots of Bath.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.199
Could you not have returned to Cornwall?
Defied your uncle?

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.639
Lived in a cottage? Dined on sprats?

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.839
In asking Dwight to leave Cornwall,
I was expecting too much of him.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.759
Since I have left Cornwall, I have realised
I was asking too much of myself.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.279
So, in effect, your love could not surmount
the obstacles?

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.319
In effect, it could not.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.879
Why do I not believe you?

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.959
What has he done?

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.799
Are you most troubled by
the thing itself or something more?

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.959
It's the thing itself.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.039
No, 'tis more. 'Tis...

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.079
It's the running away from it.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:12.919
Hiding from what has passed and the refusal to
look it in the face and stand the consequence.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.319
But...isn't that what you are doing?
Even now?

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.999
- What would you have me do?
- Oh, Demelza. I cannot instruct you.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.159
I do not even know the deed.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.639
But reason cannot guide you.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.479
Only the heart.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.199
And sometimes what the heart dictates
makes no sense at all.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.399
Yet it must be followed.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.239
- Did 'ee miss I?
- Miss 'ee? You black worm.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.959
Leaving I alone to fend off villains and footpads.
Fat lot of use you are!

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.399
You lizardy louse!

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.639
Where be the maid?

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.559
- Left us at Bargus Crossroad.
- Bound for where?

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.719
Nowhere that'll do her any good.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.159
(Chatter)

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.239
Excuse me. Ross!

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.839
(Laughter)

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.079
- Are you a figment of my imagination?
- I hope not.

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.919
I'm here to see my colonel.

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.959
- Thought I'd look you up.
- I'm astonished.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.599
Well, I'm ravenous. When do we dine?

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.159
Is Demelza well?

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.919
She didn't say. I've been in London.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.319
What on earth took you there?

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.839
Caroline.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.879
I went to thank her for the loan.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.319
And to congratulate her on her engagement.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:05.039
Which I wasn't able to do
since it turns out there's no such event.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.359
Er...I don't understand.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:12.439
I also made mention of her uncle's ill health
which may account for her decision to visit him.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.599
- Whether there's another purpose...
- What? So, Caroline's...

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.319
Where is she?

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.719
Standing just behind you.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.039
Does Ross know you're here?

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.959
Is Ross my keeper?

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.319
Why have you come?

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.359
I thought 'twas to tell you that I hate you.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.879
You've marred my faith.
You've broke my marriage.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.039
That I envy you.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.239
The passion which you rouse
that Ross could not withstand.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.959
That I pity you.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.119
Cos you could never make up your mind.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.079
Now I wonder...what do any of it matter?

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.079
What you did - Ross did -

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.239
it cannot be undone.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.799
And you both must live with that.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.639
But I need not.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.759
What will you do?

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.639
I'll take my son...

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.959
..and I'll go back to my father's house.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.799
- You would leave Ross?
- I will no longer be ruled by what he did.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.079
You're welcome to him.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:28.599
Believe me, I do not lightly meddle
in other people's affairs.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.959
That's been Demelza's way.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.359
And often I've chided her for it.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.439
But lately,
I've come around to her way ofthinking.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.079
She would say
that iftwo people love each other...

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.559
then the obstacles which keep them apart
must be substantial.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.999
Else they lack the courage oftheir convictions.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:56.039
I think she would also say life holds very few
things which are genuinely worth having.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.479
And if you possess them then...
nothing else matters.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.479
And if you don't possess them then...

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.479
..everything else is worthless.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.039
And yet, to gamble on the unknown...

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:21.359
Is not all life a gamble? And does the gambler
always come offworst?

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:27.799
I suspect that those who suffer most
are the ones that ignore their heart's desires...

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.839
and spend the rest oftheir lives regretting it.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.719
Now, no doubt, you hate me.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.959
And now, no doubt, I hate you.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.719
(Gunshot)

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.879
Aargh!

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.719
Did you fire that gun?
Judas! You might have killed me.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.719
What do you mean by firing
without checking there's folk about?

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.839
Orders, Missus. Shoot all folk who's straying.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.959
Now be off before I fire again.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:13.079
Captain Ross Poldark
of his Majesty's 62nd Regiment of Foot.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.719
Fences, my ivers. Never needed 'em in my day.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:45.039
- World's gone to pot. 'Tis a crying disgrace.
- 'Tis.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.759
- What happened?
- 'Tis just a scratch. 'Tis all.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.319
- That luggard Tom Harry.
- He never shot at thee?

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.239
- On the path by Trenwith.
- On Warleggan's orders.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.879
- I'll give him orders.
- Nay, Jud.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.399
I want no more feuding between our families.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.239
Tell no-one ofthis. Least of all Ross.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.279
- Let me bind it for thee, maid.
- I can manage.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.039
Say nothing.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.879
Have you really captured me, Doctor Enys?

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.119
- You understand this changes nothing.
- It changes everything.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.759
Caroline, I'm going to war.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.239
It'd be foolish to pretend there's no risk.
Ifthe worst should happen...

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.359
Why would you speak of such things?

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.399
Because I must.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.919
Because you are enlisting in an adventure
every bit as fraught as my own

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.959
and you must know
what you are putting your name to.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:57.319
I am putting my name aside
and taking that ofthe man that I love.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.279
How long do we have?

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.279
I sail on the morning tide.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.399
So these are our last few hours.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.399
They are.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.719
Where is your room?

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.479
JUD: He closed off our land.
- (Shouts of agreement)

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.879
- He gave her a twagging.
- An' old Prudie.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.959
- He tried to murder I.
- Have Cap'n Ross hang.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.879
And now he's gone and shot the mistress.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.199
(Angry shouts)

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:01.239
We should set a ring around Trenwith
and burn it to the ground!

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.799
(Cries of agreement)

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.119
- Who's with me?
- (Cries of agreement)

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.559
- Why didn't you stop him?
- Stop him? Why?

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.199
'Twas I that told him to go.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.279
George Warleggan do think
he can throw his weight around

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.839
and tramp common folk beneath his boot.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.559
But fire at thee? 'Tis too much.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.879
Prudie, what have you done?

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.679
(Chanting and shouting)

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.759
I think in January we'll settle in town.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.119
Trenwith is so out ofthe way and I must be
on hand to keep an eye on the new building.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.479
- The Warleggan bank?
- Hm.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.319
We start demolishing
those unsightly hovels next month.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.159
Of course, my prime concern is for you.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.319
(Door opens)

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.359
- What do you want?
- To tell you to bar your doors.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.319
There's unrest in the village.
They may march on Trenwith.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.999
You expect me to believe this?

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.879
(Sighs) I have no love of you, George.
Nor you, Elizabeth.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.319
But for the sake of Geoffrey Charles
and Agatha, I urge you.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.599
A mob would be ill-advised to trespass here.
They would be breaking the law

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.519
- and I would see to it that they hang.
- Ifthey didn't string you up first!

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.559
- Is that a threat?
- It's a plea.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.439
For him to come to his senses.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.799
- Did Ross send you?
- How could he? He'll be on his way to France.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.159
My informers tell me
he has rejoined his regiment.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.959
Oh, surely he hasn't snuck away
without telling you?

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:06.439
But perhaps having tasted defeat at home,
he's gone to vent his rage on a different enemy.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.279
- Defeat?
- As you see.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.719
His foe is in possession ofthe field.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.479
Of his ancestral home, ofthe woman he loved.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.959
And in March, the rout will be complete
when Elizabeth gives birth to a Warleggan heir.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.719
I look forward to Ross's congratulations.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.359
If he ever returns.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.559
But don't let me keep you from your scullery.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.519
Perhaps you should
barricade yourself in yours.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.639
- To what purpose?
- To save yourselffrom being lynched.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.559
(Angry shouting in distance)

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.439
Tankard. Harry! Triggs, Kemp!

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.679
(Jud cries out)

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.839
(Chanting and shouting)

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.799
Paul! Jud! Don't do this. Not for me.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.519
I beg 'ee! Lead them home.
There's women and children inside.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.359
IfWarleggan have no care for ours,
why should we care for his?

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:40.199
Don't do this. Save yourselves.
They have weapons.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.919
- So do we!
- And it's time to see him taste his own medicine!

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.679
Be advised. We have firearms
and won't hesitate to use them.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.519
Come on, then. Come on!

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.319
Don't tempt me, Mr Paynter.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.039
I would dearly love to send you to the devil.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.599
As 'ee tried to do once before.
An' see how well that worked.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.879
They'll be no second coming for you this time.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.359
Take aim.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.039
No! Stop!

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.879
These people are your neighbours.
Why do you treat them so?

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.639
They are threatening my family
and must take the consequences.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.119
- Stop this!
- (Gunshot)

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.279
(Silence descends)

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.759
Lost our nerve, have we?
Didn't fancy the battlefields of France?

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.319
My servant informed me
of one closer to home.

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.999
And on which side will you fight, Ross?

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.239
For the civilised world? Or the revolution?

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.239
On the side that stands for humanity.

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.439
Which would seem to preclude yours.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.919
So what do you intend? To incite a riot?
Quite your speciality.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.199
These people need no inciting.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.399
They would happily tear you limb from limb.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.239
- (Cries of agreement)
- And with good cause.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.479
- But they would pay for it.
- What care us?

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.319
It would be worth every penny.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.999
I urge you to go home.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:58.559
Do not give this man reason to see you hang.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.839
You have families.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.719
Wives. Children.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.639
They are worth ten
ofthis sorry excuse for a man.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.639
Now, go home.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.719
Go home.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.599
Should you notjoin your comrades?

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.999
Have a care, George.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.439
Do you really want to provoke me?

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.879
You know I could call them back in an instant.
At any time.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.839
(Scoffs) And this is what you came back for?

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.519
No.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.839
Caroline?

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.839
Oh, my dear. It's so nice to see you...here.
I'm...I'm all amazement.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.599
I've come back to care for you, Uncle.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.759
- Aww.
- Now tell me what Doctor Enys prescribes.

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.479
Here is his list of instructions.

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.599
I'm beginning to think
I misjudged that young man.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:20.919
You, of course, don't waste
a moment's thought on him, do you, eh?

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.559
Not a single one, Uncle.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.599
(Thunder rumbles)

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.279
I trust you know we were never
in any actual danger.

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:49.999
Ross thought to scare us but, in the end,
he was forced to back down.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.599
I've been thinking of Harrow.

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.599
For Geoffrey Charles.

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.639
He's still overly attached to his Mama.
We must toughen him up.

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.519
You mean send him away?

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.319
To one ofthe best schools in the country.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.239
But he's so young. And he will miss it here.

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.119
- And I...
- Will have our child to attend to.

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:26.639
Geoffrey Charles has had you all to himself.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.039
And now he must learn to be a man.

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.759
(Thunder rumbles, wind whistles)

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.879
(Sighs) So she's with child.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.639
George must be exultant.

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:07.039
To be in my family's home
and in full possession of...

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.199
Everything you hold dear.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:13.679
Not everything. But many things I hold dear.

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.959
You'll get over it.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.399
Demelza?

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.759
What are you doing?

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:59.999
I'm taking Jeremy... to my father's house.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.879
From there, who knows?

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.959
You're leaving me?

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.559
I came back for you. I chose not to go to war.

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.679
(Scoffs) 'Tis not my concern what you choose.

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.959
Only what I choose.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.639
Why would I choose a man
whose heart belonged to another?

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.319
- You are my wife.
- Raised from the gutter to be a great lady.

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.999
I'll never be such a one.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.879
But what do I care?

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.679
For I am fierce and proud
and steadfast and true.

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.439
And I'll not settle for second best.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.199
Why would you be?

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:43.719
Because you love Elizabeth.
Because you will always love Elizabeth.

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:49.199
Because you cannot conceal your pain
that George now possesses her body and soul.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.359
Do you deny it?

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.839
I do not deny that I loved her.

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.319
Long before I set eyes on you,
she was my first...

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.519
..perfect...

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.239
..untouchable love.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.879
Whereas I am dull, imperfect and ordinary.

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.399
Not ordinary. But, yes, imperfect.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.359
Human.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.679
Real.

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.959
And what that night with Elizabeth taught me...

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:32.399
and God knows, there should have been
other ways for me to come to my senses,

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.639
but my arrogance...

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.759
my idiocy...

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.679
..has been spectacular.

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.599
All I can say is...

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.679
after that night...

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:48.839
because of it...

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:53.439
I came to see that if you take an idealised love...

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.559
..and bring it down to the level
of an imperfect one...

00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:01.799
..it isn't the imperfect one which suffers.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.959
My true, real...

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.679
..and abiding love is not for her.

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.679
'Tis for you.

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:20.319
She will never come between us again.

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.559
What did you expect?

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.559
When you made a pact with the devil?

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.879
- (Thunderclap)
- I hoped, still hope...

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:48.759
..that George may be more accommodating,
once his child is born.

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.359
He may.

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.079
But are you willing to wait that long?

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.239
March is not so far away.

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.519
Unless it comes sooner.

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:02.559
What?

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.359
The child.

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.999
Why should it?

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.759
(Thunder rumbles)
