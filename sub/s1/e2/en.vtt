00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.978
For persuading father
to let me come.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.235
As official escort,
I'm entirely at your service.

00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:18.485
Don't be!

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:36.371
Is it in danger?

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:37.959
From a great many girls

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:40.045
who would be glad to acquire
the name of Poldark.

00:16:52.386 --> 00:16:53.888
Those ruffians at Wheal Reath

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:01.404
They have no business
to have an opinion at all.

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.860
Some would say
that view is outdated.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.196
In America, for instance,

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.236

must be preserved.

so dearly bought.

And Grambler's future

00:37:06.391 --> 00:37:08.564
hangs in the balance.

00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:10.104
When Welsh mines prosper
and Cornwall's on its knees,

So what do I hear
of his latest venture?

00:37:34.169 --> 00:37:37.343
The venture is small,
so overheads will be low.

00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:40.679
Without Reath, supplies
to the markets will fall,

00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:44.767
so the price of copper
should rise.

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:46.602
And if it doesn't?

00:37:46.765 --> 00:37:48.358

I really couldn't say.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.147

what will it cost us?

To begin with,

I propose to act <i>as</i> manager

00:37:57.984 --> 00:38:00.954

If Captain Henshawe
would oversee the works.

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:05.370
Also without salary?

00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:08.662
At a favorable rate,
until we're up and running.

The man has impudence!

00:38:15.585 --> 00:38:19.340
Pascoe's Bank will honor
our drafts up to 300 pounds.

Pascoe's Bank?

00:38:21.216 --> 00:38:22.216
Yes.

00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:25.432
Not Warleggans?

00:38:25.595 --> 00:38:27.472
Warleggans would be happy
to accommodate him,

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:29.687
given the friendship
between our families.

00:38:31.893 --> 00:38:34.237
But perhaps he doesn't
value friendship.

00:38:36.189 --> 00:38:37.566
Or family.

00:38:39.901 --> 00:38:42.279
Warleggans will lend to a mine
for as long as it prospers,

00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:44.163
but once it starts to struggle,

00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:46.791
they withdraw credit
and see it go under.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.418
They could close Grambler
tomorrow,

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:49.702

Business is business,

00:38:51.621 --> 00:38:53.669
but should profit be
the be-all and end-all?

00:38:53.832 --> 00:38:55.880
It ought to be.

00:38:56.042 --> 00:38:57.669
I'm inclined to agree.

00:38:57.836 --> 00:39:00.009
We knew Reath was struggling,

00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:01.889
but closing it cost
the shareholders dear.

00:39:02.048 --> 00:39:03.095
And the miners dearer.

00:39:03.258 --> 00:39:05.010
And the owner his life.

00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:09.810
We cannot choose our family,
but we can choose our friends.

00:39:09.973 --> 00:39:11.225
And as a friend, I say to you,

00:39:11.391 --> 00:39:12.671
if ever you need
my assistance...

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:14.089
And what assistance
might I need?

00:39:14.143 --> 00:39:15.235
What any man needs.

00:39:15.395 --> 00:39:16.647
Someone to alert him

00:39:16.813 --> 00:39:19.236
if he sees his friend
being played for a fool.

00:39:19.399 --> 00:39:21.072
A fool?

00:39:21.234 --> 00:39:22.281
In love, in business...

00:39:22.443 --> 00:39:23.695

00:39:23.862 --> 00:39:26.957
It's true my losses have
been considerable of late.

00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:29.209
Then let me prove our friendship

00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:32.462
by advancing
whatever might defray them.

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:35.790
Gentlemen,
I'll be straight with you.

00:39:35.957 --> 00:39:37.800
The rewards
could be considerable,

00:39:37.959 --> 00:39:40.553
but so are the risks.

00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:44.182
But if you like a wager...
And which of us here doesn't?...

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.559
Then I would sooner gamble
on a vein of copper

00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:49.312
and the sweat of 50 men
than on the turn of a card.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:55.019
50 guineas apiece will cover
the first three months.

00:39:55.184 --> 00:39:56.731
There's mine.

00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:29.523
until she swears
never to see him again.

00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:48.253
VERITY: Ross!

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.082
I heard what they told you.

00:45:51.249 --> 00:45:52.341
It isn't true.

00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:57.005
It was an accident.

00:45:57.171 --> 00:45:58.923
She tried to strike him.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.138
He pushed her away.

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.098
She fell and hit her head.

00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:04.934
He told you this?

00:46:05.096 --> 00:46:06.313
At the ball.

00:46:06.472 --> 00:46:09.225
But there was never any intent
to harm her.

00:46:09.392 --> 00:46:10.814
None in the world.

00:46:10.977 --> 00:46:12.354
And he's paid for what he did.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.943
He lost his rank
and went to prison.

00:46:15.106 --> 00:46:18.201
And I know he would never lift
a finger to hurt me.

00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:19.519
Still, how can you be sure...

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:20.610
I'm sure.

00:46:20.653 --> 00:46:22.155
He loves me.

00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:24.289
I love him.

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:27.247
You of all people know
what that feels like.

00:46:28.744 --> 00:46:30.587
Yes.

00:46:30.746 --> 00:46:31.838
(sighs)

00:46:31.998 --> 00:46:33.090
Yes.

00:46:35.668 --> 00:46:36.760
What can I do?

00:46:40.214 --> 00:46:41.932
<i>BLAMEY: Captain Poldark.</i>

00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:44.935
Most generous to allow us
to meet here

00:46:45.094 --> 00:46:47.096
in view of your concerns.

00:46:47.263 --> 00:46:48.560
Verity trusts you.

00:46:48.723 --> 00:46:49.815
I trust Verity.

00:46:49.974 --> 00:46:52.773
She's my angel of redemption.

00:46:52.935 --> 00:46:54.858
You'll have no cause
to regret it.

00:46:57.315 --> 00:46:59.363
I believe you, sir.

00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:12.003
Sir.

00:47:16.417 --> 00:47:17.418
Dammit.

00:47:17.585 --> 00:47:19.383
Tell our guests
to keep to the parlor.

00:47:34.727 --> 00:47:37.697
Farming is such an engaging
hobby, is it not?

00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:40.153
More than a hobby for me, ma'am.

00:47:40.316 --> 00:47:42.284
But do you not hunt,
Captain Poldark?

00:47:42.443 --> 00:47:43.990
Would it not be a fine thing

00:47:44.153 --> 00:47:45.913
to be mixing with people
of your own station?

00:47:46.072 --> 00:47:48.541
I'm very well occupied here.

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:50.259
Of course Ruth is
an accomplished rider.

00:47:50.368 --> 00:47:51.369
Of course.

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:53.333
Not that it's her only
accomplishment.

00:47:53.496 --> 00:47:55.669
One only has to taste
her syllabubs

00:47:55.831 --> 00:47:57.128
to know their succulence.

00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:59.168
Indeed.

00:47:59.335 --> 00:48:02.635
Is Miss Verity still
meeting that blackguard

00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:04.765
in spite of her father?

00:48:04.924 --> 00:48:06.426
I, uh...

00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:07.559
Of course you're so
out of the way here,

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:08.560
you would not hear of it.

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:10.687
No, indeed.

00:48:10.846 --> 00:48:12.223
This must be the young person

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:14.438
that you adopted?

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.444
I've adopted no one.

00:48:17.603 --> 00:48:18.775
I needed a kitchen wench.

00:48:18.938 --> 00:48:20.658
The girl is old enough
to know her own mind.

00:48:20.815 --> 00:48:21.941
Of course.

00:48:22.108 --> 00:48:25.237
She looks as if
she would know her own mind.

00:48:26.821 --> 00:48:28.949
But I must beg
your indulgence, ladies.

00:48:29.115 --> 00:48:30.867
There is much I must attend too.

00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:32.033
But you must

00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:33.794
take tea with us
at Teague House.

00:48:33.953 --> 00:48:36.206
Perhaps we can show you
what a woman's touch can do

00:48:36.372 --> 00:48:37.372
to a home.

00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:40.385
I thank you, ma'am,
but I fear...

00:48:41.544 --> 00:48:43.137
your efforts would be...

00:48:44.255 --> 00:48:45.255
wasted.

00:48:52.847 --> 00:48:55.475
Yes, of course.

00:48:55.641 --> 00:48:57.268
(faint conversation)

00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:07.532
(loud sweeping)

00:49:10.156 --> 00:49:11.954
Have you had word
of your family?

00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:13.663
No, sir.

00:49:13.826 --> 00:49:14.998
Don't expect none.

00:49:15.161 --> 00:49:16.879
Want me to skivvy for them.

00:49:17.037 --> 00:49:18.129
They'll have no love of me.

00:49:18.289 --> 00:49:19.336
Particularly your father.

00:49:19.498 --> 00:49:21.091
He's too busy

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:22.467
down in the mine.

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:23.923
And your brothers?

00:49:24.086 --> 00:49:25.713
Soon to be following
in his footsteps.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.928
Seems we both have mining
in our blood.

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:29.467
Aye, sir.

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:31.681
God knows if that's a blessing
or a curse.

00:49:34.513 --> 00:49:37.232
(thunder rumbling)

00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:48.194
This is good timing!

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.362
I was about to ride
to Wheal Leisure.

00:49:50.529 --> 00:49:52.998
The investors' meeting
went well.

00:49:53.157 --> 00:49:55.580
I hope I may yet
persuade Francis to join us.

00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:56.995
That will depend.

00:49:57.161 --> 00:49:59.459
I take nothing for granted.

00:49:59.622 --> 00:50:02.796
And I still ask for George
to be kept in the dark.

00:50:02.958 --> 00:50:05.427
I doubt your friendship
would prevent him betraying you

00:50:05.586 --> 00:50:07.008
if the need arose.

00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:09.094
Any more than our kinship

00:50:09.256 --> 00:50:11.304
has prevented you
from betraying us?

00:50:11.467 --> 00:50:13.720
Do you deny that Verity

00:50:13.886 --> 00:50:16.184
is meeting that man
at your house?

00:50:16.347 --> 00:50:18.395
I think you misjudge him.

00:50:18.557 --> 00:50:20.150
I think I've misjudged you!

00:50:30.361 --> 00:50:31.453
Filthy skunk!

00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:33.865
Sneaking behind our backs
to debauch my sister!

00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:35.123
Deceiving her family...

00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:36.374
Francis, please!

00:50:36.534 --> 00:50:37.831
If you and your father
refuse to meet me...

00:50:37.993 --> 00:50:40.087
We do not deal
with wife murderers!

00:50:40.246 --> 00:50:41.873
I have a right
to choose my own life!

00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:43.791
Honor means nothing
to your sort.

00:50:43.958 --> 00:50:45.005
Well, perhaps a thrashing will!

00:50:45.167 --> 00:50:47.215
Not in my house!

00:50:47.378 --> 00:50:48.971
You have the impudence
to take his side?

00:50:49.129 --> 00:50:50.597
I take no one's side,

00:50:50.756 --> 00:50:52.508
but you won't change the issue
with this foolery.

00:50:52.675 --> 00:50:55.303
I have no wish to quarrel,
but Verity is coming with me.

00:50:55.469 --> 00:50:56.891
That she is not!

00:50:57.054 --> 00:50:58.727
There'll be no cleaning
of your boots on this family!

00:50:58.889 --> 00:50:59.889
You insolent puppy!

00:50:59.932 --> 00:51:00.932
Oh, "puppy," is it?

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.493
When will it be convenient
for you to meet me,

00:51:11.652 --> 00:51:12.494
Captain Blarney?

00:51:12.653 --> 00:51:13.653
As soon as you like, sir.

00:51:13.696 --> 00:51:14.367
VERITY: Andrew, no!

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:15.156
Francis, please...

00:51:15.322 --> 00:51:15.948
Get me a pistol.

00:51:16.115 --> 00:51:17.115
Get one yourself.

00:51:20.619 --> 00:51:22.747
This fellow claims to be
a gentleman.

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:24.540
Let him step outside
and prove it!

00:51:24.707 --> 00:51:25.799
Francis, no!

00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:27.960
Ross, stop them!

00:51:28.127 --> 00:51:29.219
Stop him, he's out
of his depth, Charles.

00:51:29.378 --> 00:51:30.800
Francis, I implore you...

00:51:35.551 --> 00:51:37.974
Andrew, please, for my sake!

00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:39.980
CHARLES: Francis!

00:51:40.139 --> 00:51:42.016
Have no truck
with this scoundrel!

00:51:42.182 --> 00:51:44.105
Verity will come home with us.

00:51:44.268 --> 00:51:45.394
Yes, Father!

00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:47.361
It's gone beyond that...
The skunk insulted me!

00:51:47.396 --> 00:51:49.364
Fight it out with fists, then.

00:51:49.523 --> 00:51:50.923
He's not worth the risk
of a pistol!

00:51:51.025 --> 00:51:52.277
Do you want this family
to be a laughingstock?

00:51:52.443 --> 00:51:54.320
Francis, I urge you
to consider...

00:51:54.486 --> 00:51:55.783
Consider what?

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:58.199
That anyone may abuse our trust
and take advantage of us?

00:51:58.365 --> 00:51:59.537
Francis, I beg you...

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:03.079
I will have satisfaction.

00:52:03.245 --> 00:52:04.667
You there, act as referee.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:05.626
Can you count?

00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:07.132
Aye, sir.

00:52:07.291 --> 00:52:07.962
One, two, four, seven...

00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:09.297
Do it ourselves.

00:52:13.672 --> 00:52:14.844
One...

00:52:15.007 --> 00:52:16.224
Two...

00:52:16.383 --> 00:52:17.503
Stop them, please stop them!

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:22.727
Four, five, six,

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:25.689
seven, eight,

00:52:25.851 --> 00:52:27.228
nine,

00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:28.771

00:52:34.193 --> 00:52:35.193
(gunshots)

00:52:40.032 --> 00:52:41.158
Francis!

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.299
(thunder rumbling)

00:52:54.296 --> 00:52:55.388
<i>Prudie!</i>

00:52:55.547 --> 00:52:56.799
Fetch me some water.

00:53:04.556 --> 00:53:06.103
I know it was not
your intention.

00:53:06.266 --> 00:53:07.483
God forbid.

00:53:09.186 --> 00:53:10.233
Help me stop the bleeding.

00:53:11.188 --> 00:53:12.030
I can't, sir.

00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:13.862
I be afeared of the blood.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.117
<i>VERITY: Surely you must see</i>

00:53:16.276 --> 00:53:18.904
how impossible it would be
for us to be together now?

00:53:19.071 --> 00:53:22.200
I do see.

00:53:22.366 --> 00:53:23.726
I'll help, sir...
I bain't afeared.

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:49.436
Good-bye, Verity.

00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:13.334
(sobbing)

00:54:19.423 --> 00:54:20.640
Where is he?

00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:28.514
Oh, God!

00:54:28.557 --> 00:54:30.104
No, no, no!

00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:31.769
How could you let this happen?

00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:32.356
Elizabeth...

00:54:32.519 --> 00:54:33.519
You let him die!

00:54:33.645 --> 00:54:34.897
How could you let him die?

00:54:35.063 --> 00:54:36.063
Speak to him.

00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:03.976
Your cousin do owe you his life.

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:06.978
Where'd you learn
to do such things?

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:08.764
On the battlefields of Virginia.

00:55:10.516 --> 00:55:11.608
(loud knock)

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:23.120
You are a disgrace
to the name of Poldark.

00:55:23.278 --> 00:55:25.280
I'm sorry you think so.

00:55:25.447 --> 00:55:27.791
I offer no thanks.

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:29.918
I feel no gratitude.

00:55:30.077 --> 00:55:33.001
I hold you entirely to blame.

00:55:34.456 --> 00:55:35.582
I understand.

00:55:45.425 --> 00:55:47.223
I do not blame you.

00:55:47.386 --> 00:55:48.906
I wouldn't for the world
wish him hurt.

00:55:49.054 --> 00:55:50.146
I know that.

00:55:50.305 --> 00:55:52.899
And I'm grateful
for all you've done.

00:55:53.058 --> 00:55:54.310
Come, Elizabeth!

00:55:56.728 --> 00:55:57.820
The more so now since,

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:01.325
more than ever,
I need him well and at my side.

00:56:04.778 --> 00:56:06.280
I'm with child.

00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:11.000
CHARLES: Elizabeth!

00:56:37.394 --> 00:56:40.364
Do I have "half-wit"
branded across my forehead?

00:56:40.522 --> 00:56:42.240
No.

00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:44.777
Yet I fell for it again.

00:56:44.943 --> 00:56:47.696
Built a castle
out of winks and smiles.

00:56:47.863 --> 00:56:49.115
All the while...

00:56:52.284 --> 00:56:53.877
I should be grateful.

00:56:54.036 --> 00:56:56.289
What clearer proof is needed?

00:56:58.206 --> 00:56:59.423
(exhales deeply)

00:57:01.168 --> 00:57:02.841
Fetch Jim and Jud and Prudie.

00:57:03.003 --> 00:57:04.596
We have work to do.

00:57:54.388 --> 00:57:56.390
You did well today.

00:57:56.556 --> 00:58:00.857
I can see how valuable
you must be to your family.

00:58:01.019 --> 00:58:02.111
Sir?

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:03.271
And if you miss them...

00:58:03.438 --> 00:58:05.238
If you feel their need
is greater than mine...

00:58:05.399 --> 00:58:06.399
You be wanting rid of me?

00:58:06.525 --> 00:58:08.698
What?

00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:09.656
You be wishing me gone?

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.572
Sir, I'll work harder.

00:58:11.738 --> 00:58:13.331
I'll scrub and scour
and fettle and...

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:15.250
Demelza, your work is
more than satisfactory.

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.417
Then why, sir?

00:58:16.576 --> 00:58:17.576
I was merely offering you

00:58:17.703 --> 00:58:18.829
the chance to return
to your home.

00:58:18.996 --> 00:58:22.296
If that's where you feel
you belong.

00:58:24.793 --> 00:58:26.136
I belong here.

00:58:34.386 --> 00:58:36.104
I belong here.
