WEBVTT

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.750


00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.493
Propose.

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:32.078
Two.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:33.959
What's the stake?

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:36.711
Your ring?

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.962
CAPTAIN:
Gambling again, Poldark.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.505
Remind me why you enlisted?

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:48.674
To escape the gallows, sir.

00:00:50.092 --> 00:00:51.514
Your crime?

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:52.849
Brawling, sir.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:56.265
Free trading, assaulting
a customs official.

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:02.776
Wastrels and thieves,
the lot of you.

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:04.736
But you'll soon have the honor

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:05.740
of redeeming yourselves

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.367
in the service
of king and country.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.113
You doubt the justice
of our cause, sir?

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.123
And what cause
would that be, sir?

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:15.000
Liberty or tyranny?

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.428
You want to leave here?

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:27.679
Or die here?!

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.266
On your feet, man!

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.521
On your feet!

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.612
<i>WOMAN".
Pray do not be reckless.</i>

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:54.790
<i>I wish you to return.</i>

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:57.751
POLDARK:
It won't be for long.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:58.910
You'll forget me.

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:00.169
POLDARK:
Never!

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.890


00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.444
WOMAN (whispering):
Are you sure?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.489
SECOND WOMAN: I trust I may believe
the evidence of my own eyes, dear.

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:19.408
FIRST WOMAN:
Was he not reported dead?

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:20.951
MAN (whispering):
Better if he had been.

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:23.917
He's brought little credit
to his family.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.626
SECOND WOMAN:
His father was no different.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.462
<i>A scoundrel.</i>

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.924
And a libertine.

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.686
SECOND WOMAN: Still the family
name counts for something.

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:41.063
And now he's to inherit...

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:49.814
ls my father dead?

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.527
Oh, sir!

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.112
Bless me!

00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:55.744
We had no idea
you were awake.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.370
When did he die?

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.288
Some six months past.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.454
You'd had no word?

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.963
None that reached me.

00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:22.138
How was the war, sir?

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:25.691
<i>As any war, ma'am.</i>

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.436
A waste of good men.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:37.410
OLDER WOMAN: You're not
going home to Nampara?

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.037
To my Uncle Charles first,
ma'am.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.665
Since my father will evidently
not be at home,

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.748
I must look for a welcome
elsewhere.

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.809
Do the honors, Verity.

00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:44.561
And no half-measures!

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.393
I couldn't eat
another morsel.

00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:50.184
Piffle, girl,
you're as thin as a wraith.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.229
We must fatten you up!

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.113
Perhaps Francis
will be able to coax her.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:58.572
I happen to like her
just as she is.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.656
(door opens)
Was that the door?

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:01.991
Were you expecting
someone, my dear?

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:05.748
She's too valuable here to be
thinking of gentlemen callers!

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.504
I hope I'm not intruding.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.627
(gasping):
Oh, Ross!

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.222
We'd given up all hope.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.178
Stap me, boy, you survived!

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.842
MAN:
To see you again, cousin!

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.140
We had quite despaired.

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:27.350
Hadn't we, Elizabeth?

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.014
Yes.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.100
Elizabeth!

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.478
I had no idea you'd be here.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:38.569
Do tell us, Ross,
how we managed to lose the war.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.611
By choosing the wrong side,
ma'am.

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.697
I couldn't have wished
for a better homecoming.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.491
I must speak with you, Ross.

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:48.704
Yes, of course.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:55.548
And what will you do
with yourself now, nephew?

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:56.879
You'll find Nampara

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.885
not as you left it.

00:06:59.044 --> 00:06:59.920
Damn me, boy!

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.463
If we hadn't thought
you'd gone

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.382
to join the Blest Above!

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:07.143
Great-Aunt, I'm glad to see you
are still of the Blest Below.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.897
We'd had no word
from you, so...

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:12.808
Sit here, Ross,
you must be exhausted.

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:17.024
Elizabeth, fetch me
my wrap.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.443
Yes, Mama.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.968
I seem to have interrupted
a party.

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.721
Is this in honor of the peace
or of the next war?

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.802
FRANCIS:
No, um...

00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:50.062
Well... the occasion is...

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.723
Something far more pleasant.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.015
My boy is to be married.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.815
But that's tremendous!

00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.321
Who is it to be?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.823
Elizabeth.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:04.530
(quietly):
Elizabeth?

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.371
Elizabeth?

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:16.250
MOTHER:
Naturally we're delighted

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:18.381
that our two ancient
and distinguished families

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.508
will be united.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.190
Did my father suffer much,
Uncle?

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.482
A pitiful end.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:43.990
Affairs in tatters
and next to nothing left

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.446
for you to inherit.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:48.077
Not that we thought
you'd be back to claim it!

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:51.831
UNCLE: It's a poor Cornwall
you've returned to.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.162
Taxes sky high,

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:54.496
wages in the gutter...

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.377
Mine closures
every other week.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:57.503
CHARLES:
Bad as you, lad!

00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:59.835
Scarred for life,
on its knees!

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:01.215
I can't stay.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:05.504
I've only called to let
you know I've returned.

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.972
I must trouble you
for a horse, Charles.

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:13.645
But first, a toast.

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:21.145
To Elizabeth and Francis...

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:25.987
May they find happiness
together.

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:28.072
ALL (quietly):
Elizabeth and Francis.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.575
Jud?

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:53.407
Prudie?

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:50.801
On your feet now!

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.712
Judas!

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.222
Is it Mr. Ross?

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.256
Back from the grave.

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:14.993
You were my father's
personal servants.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.242
You were left in a position
of trust.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.247
Well, pick me liver,
what could us do,

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.033
left alone

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.827
with no master to guide us?

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.212
I'll guide you with the side
of my foot in future.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.123
But see, 'twas rumored
you were dead.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:29.836
Perhaps you started the tale?

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:32.593
Ain't no call
to accuse us, Mr. Ross.

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.971
'Tisn't right, 'tisn't fair,
'tisn't fit, 'tisn't friendly.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.429
You'll get "friendly"
if I don't see my face reflected

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.888
in this floor by the time
you're done.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.220
Ross looked well.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:13:59.801
He did.

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:01.432
Better than one might
have expected.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.389
Considering
one thought him dead.

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:10.726
Elizabeth will make
a fine mistress of Trenwith.

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.735
Not for three months, that.

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:15.067
Your father thinks
it should be sooner.

00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.355
Does he?

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:21.119
His view is if two young people
wish to be together,

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:24.907
what is there to wait for?

00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:42.302
Can it be?

00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:51.265
It isn't a ghost?

00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:52.524
See for yourself!

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:54.606
We heard you took a bullet!

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:55.611
I dodged a few!

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.898
And got a title?

00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.031
Captain Poldark!

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.155
And the war?

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:04.036
An education, Jim.

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:06.705
Well...

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.372
What happened here?

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:13.505
Since your father died,
we've had no repairs.

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.506
I'll remedy that.

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.588
You were my father's tenants,
now you're mine.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.003
Nay, Ross, you've got
enough to think on,

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:23.013
with ruined home
and barren land.

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:24.515
I have hands, do I not?

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:25.766
A spade, a plough...

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.017
Well, we can help you.

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:29.478
I cannot pay you.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.230
I would not expect it.

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.107
You labored long enough in
my uncle's mine for a pittance.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.609
I'll not have you
serve me for nothing.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.690
Ross?

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:38.446
What did happen out there?

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.275
<i>L</i> grew UP-

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.132
Mr. Poldark to see you,
Miss Elizabeth.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:20.860
My dear, I have great news.

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:36.671
Your father left
very little of value.

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:44.971
The house, two derelict mines,
a few decaying cottages.

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:48.554
The land, I fear,
has been left to rot?

00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.935
Entirely.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:53.141
So you come to inquire
as to credit?

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:56.604
As your friend,
I would back you to the hilt.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:17:00.145
As your banker,
I'm obliged to disappoint.

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:05.324
Your father had debts,
your property is mortgaged,

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.111
your land has no income.

00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:09.574
I'm a poor risk.

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:10.659
Quite so.

00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:13.745
And my tenants,
can I do nothing for them?

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.707
I know you have an affection
for these people,

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.793
but you can barely support
yourself, let alone them.

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:21.048
Then you'd advise me...

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:22.925
Look to your own devices.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.587
Seek your fortune
as and where you may.

00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:27.380
Beggars cannot be choosers?

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:30.801
I hope you may rely on the
friend, if not the banker.

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.435
I hope so, too.

00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:36.188
For I need all the friends
I can get.

00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:53.156
Ross Poldark is alive.

00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:55.450
That wastrel?

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:57.710
At school
I rather admired him.

00:17:57.868 --> 00:18:00.792
He said what he thought,
did what he liked.

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:02.628
And where did it get him?

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.713
It got him a following.

00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:07.253
Something we frequently
fail to acquire.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.345
I wonder if he might
not be useful to us?

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:12.599
His father's dead.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.760
He has no obvious
source of income.

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:18.227
If we could rally him
to our cause...

00:18:18.389 --> 00:18:19.561
To what end?

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:21.146
He has an ancient
family name.

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:25.109
Doors which are closed to us
might open for him.

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:29.650
What inducements could we offer?

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:33.697
His need at present
must be severe.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.285
(scoffs)
You mean to buy his friendship?

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:38.748
I'd rather he bestowed it
willingly.

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:42.914
I find people are very friendly

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.003
when they cannot afford
not to be.

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:57.057
Elizabeth,
where are you going?

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:59.267
I must speak with Ross, Mama.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.057
To what purpose?

00:19:01.223 --> 00:19:03.521
To explain.

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:05.561
To ask him,
what shall we do?

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:06.945
There is nothing to do.

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:09.653
You are engaged to Francis.

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:11.283
But Ross and I...

00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:12.318
Where is he now?

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:13.577
Has he come to see you?

00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:17.616
What can he offer you
but poverty, uncertainty,

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.079
a dubious reputation.

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:20.959
I do not care
about reputation.

00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:22.870
But you should.

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:25.131
Francis adores you.

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:27.166
You will be mistress
of Trenwith.

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:30.257
Had Ross not returned, would you
have the slightest hesitation?

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:31.591
But he has returned.

00:19:31.754 --> 00:19:35.679
If he still cared for you,
would he not have been

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.935
at the door by now?

00:19:52.483 --> 00:19:54.110
Just clearing the field,
Mr. Ross.

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:58.952
A cheering spectacle,
and a need for one.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:01.664
Hard work is now required if
we're to put food on the table.

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:03.578
Hard work?

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:06.372
I can see you're unfamiliar
with the concept.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.506
Let me clarify:

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:08.837
We have nothing to live on

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:10.626
beyond the fruits
of our own labors.

00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:13.546
We shall need
to tighten our belts,

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:16.262
and in some cases,
that can only be to the good.

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:20.516
Verity!

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:33.157
You would have been surprised
to hear about Elizabeth.

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:36.194
I had no option
on the girl.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.079
It was strange how it happened.

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:40.581
One moment
she barely noticed Francis.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.083
The next...

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:44.539
She noticed his mine,
his house, his estate?

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.833
That was uncalled for.

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:57.639
The Wedding's in a fortnight.

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:00.555
So soon?

00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:02.720
I wish I could help you,
my dear.

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:05.356
I must find my own way
out of this.

00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:21.014
An alarming prospect,
is it not?

00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:26.395
A lifetime with me.

00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:34.482
I cannot promise to be
<i>as</i> fascinating as some.

00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:38.775
Or as bold or reckless.

00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:43.575
But one thing
I can promise you.

00:22:43.737 --> 00:22:46.286
My undying love.

00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:50.169
And gratitude.

00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:57.506
But if there is... something
that still troubles you...

00:22:57.668 --> 00:23:01.172
If there is something
that you wish to tell me?

00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:10.306
There is.

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:20.817
I wish to tell you that
I cannot wait to be your wife.

00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:44.181
FRANCIS:
Should you be doing this?

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:47.101
I cannot afford a farmhand.

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:49.011
Your father would not
have wished you to stoop.

00:23:49.178 --> 00:23:53.058
My father would not
have wished me to starve.

00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:54.315
She's proved a poor legacy.

00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:56.022
Certainly a fickle one.

00:23:56.185 --> 00:23:58.483
Well, her time may come again.

00:24:00.898 --> 00:24:03.572
Perhaps I should examine her.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.578
Is that wise?

00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:14.248
FRANCIS:
How deep did they drive it?

00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:15.754
POLDARK:
30 fathoms.

00:24:15.913 --> 00:24:17.540
Most of it will be
underwater by now.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.389
Ross, my...
my father's concerned.

00:24:27.383 --> 00:24:30.637
That... you should make
the right choices.

00:24:34.223 --> 00:24:37.602
Face... face
certain realities.

00:24:40.396 --> 00:24:42.364
Accept that your future
may lie elsewhere.

00:24:42.523 --> 00:24:44.366
I thank him for his concern.

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:49.075
Ross, you do know I'm to be
married next week?

00:24:49.238 --> 00:24:51.115
And?

00:24:52.658 --> 00:24:55.753
You've... you've not yet
accepted our invitation.

00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:59.006
I've things to attend to.

00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:00.165
But you must come.

00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:01.709
I'm not one for ceremonies.

00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:04.970
Ross, it is our dearest wish...

00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:16.232
Ross?

00:25:18.058 --> 00:25:20.982
You must understand,
when I first met Elizabeth,

00:25:21.145 --> 00:25:22.863
there was no thought
of my coming between you,

00:25:23.022 --> 00:25:25.571
but what could I do?

00:25:25.733 --> 00:25:28.486
My feelings- our feelings
for each other...

00:25:28.652 --> 00:25:30.450
For God's sake,
must you rub my nose in it?!

00:25:40.748 --> 00:25:43.046
Ross! For pity's...!

00:25:58.849 --> 00:26:01.773
Why the hell don't you
learn to swim?

00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:06.657
For a moment I thought...
I thought you'd let me drown.

00:26:08.275 --> 00:26:10.903
For a moment I thought so, too.

00:26:32.716 --> 00:26:40.771
PRIEST: Elizabeth, wilt thou hast
this man as your wedded husband?

00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:42.935
<i>To live together
after God's ordinance</i>

00:26:43.102 --> 00:26:47.073
<i>in a state of holy matrimony.</i>

00:26:47.231 --> 00:26:49.950
<i>Will thou love, honor,
and keep him...</i>

00:26:54.863 --> 00:26:59.710
<i>...forsaking all others so long
as you both shall live?</i>

00:27:04.206 --> 00:27:07.380
ELIZABETH:
I will.

00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:14.597
PRIEST: Those who God hath joined
together let no man put asunder.

00:27:26.603 --> 00:27:30.358
POLDARK: George has
done well for himself.

00:27:30.524 --> 00:27:32.492
VERITY: As you'll discover, the
Warleggans are on the rise.

00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:39.742
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
a proud day for the Poldarks.

00:27:59.553 --> 00:28:01.430
I wish you could dance, Ross.

00:28:01.597 --> 00:28:04.476
I thank an American musket
for sparing me the ordeal.

00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:18.994
Perhaps I should have purchased
her for you, nephew.

00:28:19.156 --> 00:28:22.330
I broker my own business
these days.

00:28:22.492 --> 00:28:23.789
Well, she'll be wasted here.

00:28:23.952 --> 00:28:27.877
These Poldarks have nothing
beyond the name.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.384
Mine on its knees
and mortgaged to the hilt,

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:34.263
Warleggans Bank may send in the
bailiffs as and when it chooses.

00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:37.425
This is elegant talk
for a wedding, Uncle!

00:28:37.591 --> 00:28:41.141
Talk of a profit is
always elegant, George.

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:01.289
My compliments on the scratch!

00:29:01.448 --> 00:29:03.496
Was it got
in any actual fighting

00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:05.707
or another gambling brawl?

00:29:05.869 --> 00:29:07.291
Old habits die hard.

00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:14.678
I was sorry to hear
of your father.

00:29:16.838 --> 00:29:18.761
We have something in common.

00:29:18.924 --> 00:29:20.517
Both fatherless?

00:29:20.676 --> 00:29:22.394
Hostages to our
family's fortune.

00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:25.055
And there the similarity ends.

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:30.106
Cornwall is changing.

00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:33.068
These are difficult times.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:38.157
I trust you will feel
you can rely on your friends.

00:29:38.318 --> 00:29:39.661
What for?

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.618
Well, whatever
you might require.

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.078
Thank you, George,
I believe I can manage.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.919
Do you believe breeding
can ever be bought?

00:29:55.085 --> 00:29:57.008
You should ask your uncle.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.176
Elizabeth would be delighted

00:30:02.342 --> 00:30:05.095
by talk of bailiffs
on her wedding day.

00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:08.141
Well, Elizabeth's delight is
surely no longer your concern.

00:30:08.307 --> 00:30:09.559
There you are, Ross!

00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:11.568
I've been sent to find you.

00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:20.326
CHARLES:
Let the fight commence!

00:30:25.741 --> 00:30:27.994
VERITY:
You see?

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.127
He hadn't left
after all!

00:30:37.294 --> 00:30:40.218
I was glad to see
you at church.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.303
You must wonder why
I wished you there.

00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:53.151
After that night,
when we had no chance to speak,

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:56.154
I thought you would
come to see me.

00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:01.197
Why would I do that?

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.240
To give me a chance
to explain, to apologize.

00:31:05.405 --> 00:31:07.328
For what?

00:31:07.491 --> 00:31:10.290
There was no formal
undertaking between us.

00:31:10.452 --> 00:31:13.331
Not officially, no.

00:31:15.999 --> 00:31:17.922
But you know there
was something--

00:31:18.085 --> 00:31:20.429
an understanding.

00:31:22.798 --> 00:31:25.176
But three years is
a long time, Ross.

00:31:25.342 --> 00:31:27.436
MRS. CHYNOWETH:
Elizabeth.

00:31:27.594 --> 00:31:30.643
Remember your duty as a bride
is to all your guests?

00:31:30.806 --> 00:31:34.310
I've no taste
for fighting, Mama.

00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:35.978
Are you a fan
of the sport, Ross?

00:31:36.144 --> 00:31:37.111
Perhaps
you'll instruct me

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.567
in its finer points.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.449
I doubt there are
any subtleties of combat

00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:43.155
on which I can offer
you advice, ma'am.

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:48.035
I'll send Francis to you.

00:31:50.826 --> 00:31:52.954
You mustn't blame my mother.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.838
This was my decision.

00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:56.293
And we must abide by it.

00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:00.719
And we shall be neighbors?

00:32:02.838 --> 00:32:04.340
And friends?

00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:06.554
If you say so.

00:32:08.427 --> 00:32:09.895
FRANCIS:
Feeling neglected, my dear?

00:32:10.053 --> 00:32:12.681
May I claim my bride, Ross?

00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:50.469
Still a good day
for Poldarks?

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:52.012
Don't encourage her.

00:32:53.763 --> 00:32:56.016
The dark Poldark?

00:32:56.183 --> 00:32:57.480
Or the fair?

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:04.316
AU <i>NT AGATHA:
The stronger rises</i>

00:33:04.483 --> 00:33:06.485
as the weaker falls.

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:20.085
For all is fair in love and war.

00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:50.662
Still feeding that pair
of wastrels?

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.666
If you turfed them out,
you could afford to buy stock.

00:33:54.824 --> 00:33:55.950
They were my father's friends.

00:33:57.536 --> 00:34:00.130
You drive yourself hard, boy.

00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:03.212
It keeps me out of mischief.

00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:05.173
I'm not unfeeling, Ross.

00:34:05.335 --> 00:34:09.465
I know your father had the worst
of the land and the property.

00:34:09.631 --> 00:34:11.429
The lot of a younger son.

00:34:13.593 --> 00:34:15.812
I'd like to show
you something.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:20.108
What do you see?

00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:21.359
N.

00:34:21.518 --> 00:34:23.441
Your mine.
Not so.

00:34:23.603 --> 00:34:27.107
What you see is the past.

00:34:27.274 --> 00:34:29.072
Does it not still produce?

00:34:29.234 --> 00:34:30.861
Precious little.

00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:32.995
And nothing to trouble
the Welsh mines

00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:35.327
where they're dragging it out
by the cart-load.

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:38.869
Meantime, we are sunk in debt.

00:34:40.245 --> 00:34:41.838
The bankers have us
by the throat.

00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:44.250
I'm sorry.

00:34:44.416 --> 00:34:46.009
And your mines?

00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:47.419
What of them?

00:34:48.712 --> 00:34:51.465
Even worse than Grambler.

00:34:51.631 --> 00:34:53.508
Derelict, both of them.

00:34:53.675 --> 00:34:55.143
Your land?

00:34:55.302 --> 00:34:57.304
Barren.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:00.314
There's nothing
for you here, boy.

00:35:00.473 --> 00:35:03.352
Your future
lies elsewhere.

00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:06.067
A change of profession.

00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:07.321
The law, perhaps?

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.608
Or even the church.

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.196
Do you really
not know me, Uncle?

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:13.032
A move to London.

00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:14.286
Oxford?

00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:16.414
I'll fund it.

00:35:16.573 --> 00:35:21.079
Your education,
your expenses.

00:35:21.244 --> 00:35:23.463
I believe it's what
your father would have wanted.

00:35:23.622 --> 00:35:27.252
And Francis, what do you
believe he would want?

00:35:27.417 --> 00:35:29.511
For you to prosper.

00:35:29.669 --> 00:35:31.296
Away from here.

00:35:31.463 --> 00:35:34.683
I think that would be best
for all concerned.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.272
I'll think on it.

00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:43.559
You should be biting
my hand off!

00:35:43.725 --> 00:35:45.773
And may yet do so.

00:35:45.935 --> 00:35:47.903
But till I've exhausted
every possibility

00:35:48.063 --> 00:35:50.862
of making a living on my own
land, among my own people...

00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:53.573
Damn your stubbornness, boy!

00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:57.330
The land is useless,
its people are starving.

00:35:57.489 --> 00:35:59.958
What possible reason
is there to stay?

00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:22.230
Today's market day?

00:36:22.389 --> 00:36:25.518
Aye, sir, 'tis, sir.

00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:28.403
Well, don't stand there
gawping, Jud!

00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:30.359
Fetch me my father's
pocket-watch.

00:38:06.409 --> 00:38:07.626
Hey, that's my dog!

00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:08.878
Go away!

00:38:09.037 --> 00:38:10.755
Garrick!

00:38:10.914 --> 00:38:12.257
Get off him!

00:38:12.415 --> 00:38:13.166
Garrick!

00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:14.755
Get off him!

00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:16.135
Garrick!
Let him go!

00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:23.301
Enough!

00:38:26.012 --> 00:38:27.434
You take my advice, you run.

00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:28.689
Or else?

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:36.856
Have they hurt you, child?

00:38:37.023 --> 00:38:38.445
Don't you "child" me, mister!

00:38:42.403 --> 00:38:43.950
I think we've provided
enough sport for one day.

00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:02.883
Anyone know this child?

00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:09.063
It's Tom Game's daughter
from Illuggan.

00:39:09.222 --> 00:39:11.316
She'll get the strap
if he catches her from home

00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:12.646
and in her brother's clothes.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.234
Easy, girl.

00:39:16.396 --> 00:39:17.898
No one will rob you.

00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:37.842
I came to see if the boy was...

00:39:39.586 --> 00:39:41.008
Oh!

00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:46.100
You were right to step in.

00:39:46.259 --> 00:39:47.431
I'm glad you think so.

00:39:47.594 --> 00:39:50.143
I'm sure the child is grateful.

00:39:50.305 --> 00:39:52.182
I doubt it.
(door opens)

00:39:53.641 --> 00:39:54.893
Elizabeth?

00:40:08.698 --> 00:40:09.824
They did hurt you.

00:40:13.453 --> 00:40:14.545
Not they.

00:40:14.704 --> 00:40:16.172
Then who?

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.132
(softly):
My father.

00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:19.918
What?
Father.

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:20.835
Beats you?

00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:22.629
Most days.

00:40:22.795 --> 00:40:23.921
Family?

00:40:25.757 --> 00:40:27.555
Six brothers.

00:40:27.717 --> 00:40:30.095
Do you love your father?

00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:33.143
Bible <i>says</i> I must.

00:40:35.808 --> 00:40:37.981
What's your name?

00:40:38.144 --> 00:40:40.067
(softly):
Melzacarne.

00:40:40.229 --> 00:40:41.321
Speak up, child.

00:40:41.481 --> 00:40:44.155
(loudly):
Demelza Carne.

00:40:44.317 --> 00:40:46.490
Ross Poldark.

00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:50.911
Befriending the rabble, Ross?

00:40:51.074 --> 00:40:53.827
One would never guess
you were a gentleman.

00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:56.416
It takes one to know one,
I believe, George.

00:41:02.627 --> 00:41:06.723
For a man so impecunious,
he's very full of himself.

00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:09.259
Perhaps he considers
us tradesmen.

00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:10.517
Which we are.

00:41:10.677 --> 00:41:12.054
Were.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:16.020
It's a pity he owns nothing
worth having.

00:41:16.182 --> 00:41:18.230
Come.

00:41:18.393 --> 00:41:20.942
I'm taking you home
to llluggan.

00:41:21.104 --> 00:41:23.948
He may do so in future.

00:41:24.107 --> 00:41:28.328
When he does, it will be
my pleasure to take it from him.

00:41:30.822 --> 00:41:32.074
Go.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:38.962
You're back early.

00:41:39.122 --> 00:41:40.339
How was market day?

00:41:40.498 --> 00:41:42.876
(chuckling):
Not without incident.

00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:52.727
DEMELZA: ♪ There was an old
couple and they was poor ♪

00:41:52.885 --> 00:41:55.889
♪ They lived in a house
that had but one door ♪

00:41:56.055 --> 00:41:59.810
♪ Oh, what a poor couple
was they, was they... ♪

00:41:59.976 --> 00:42:03.401
Illuggan's that way.

00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:07.199
Thank you, sir.

00:42:08.818 --> 00:42:11.788
♪ There was an old couple
and they was poor ♪

00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:13.539
♪ Tweedle Tweedle Tweedle dee ♪

00:42:13.698 --> 00:42:16.121
♪ Oh I have been sick since
you have been gone... ♪

00:42:16.284 --> 00:42:17.536
I'm in need of a kitchen maid.

00:42:19.996 --> 00:42:22.875
You'd get food, lodging,
proper clothing.

00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:27.763
I want someone strong,
for the work is hard.

00:42:29.797 --> 00:42:31.424
How far?

00:42:31.591 --> 00:42:33.719
Too far to run home.

00:42:35.678 --> 00:42:37.225
But perhaps you don't wish
to come.

00:42:40.141 --> 00:42:41.859
There be Garrick, sir.

00:42:42.018 --> 00:42:43.986
Him and me be friends.

00:42:44.145 --> 00:42:46.273
Where I go, he goes.

00:43:05.666 --> 00:43:06.792
Who we have here?

00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:08.176
This is Demelza.

00:43:08.336 --> 00:43:10.213
She's to help in the kitchen.

00:43:10.379 --> 00:43:12.222
Picking up brats will bring
you no end of trouble.

00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:13.883
See to the horse.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:15.723
She'll be seething
with crawlers.

00:43:15.885 --> 00:43:19.640
Not if I give her the same
treatment I gave you.

00:43:19.806 --> 00:43:22.650
'Tisn't right, 'tisn't fair,
'tisn't fit, 'tisn't proper.

00:43:22.809 --> 00:43:26.154
POLDARK: If you work for me, you
must be clean, do you understand?

00:43:26.312 --> 00:43:27.404
No lice.

00:43:27.563 --> 00:43:28.780
Yes, sir...

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.317
Ain't no vittles for her.

00:43:30.483 --> 00:43:31.655
Find some.

00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:33.786
Scarce feed us selves,
how you going to feed

00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:35.242
another beside?

00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:36.906
Leave that to me.

00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:14.197
What she be smirking at?

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.953
Blathering blasted brat!

00:44:16.112 --> 00:44:17.204
How old she be?

00:44:17.363 --> 00:44:18.706
Old enough to know her own mind!

00:44:18.865 --> 00:44:21.288
Not too big to feel
the back of my hand.

00:44:30.168 --> 00:44:31.294
Prudie?

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.928
When did this letter come?

00:44:33.087 --> 00:44:35.761
PRUDIE: Just now, sir,
from your Uncle Charles.

00:45:03.326 --> 00:45:04.828
Don't lurk out there, girl,
come in.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.384
Have Jud and Prudie
made you welcome?

00:45:13.085 --> 00:45:14.587
Of course not.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.927
You must learn to stand up
for yourself.

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.434
Show them you have
a mind of your own

00:45:20.593 --> 00:45:22.186
and you will not
be dictated to.

00:45:25.973 --> 00:45:28.101
Clear this away.

00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:32.605
To Prudie, not your dog.

00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:36.571
Yes, sir.

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:44.375
I been thinking, sir,
about Garrick, sir.

00:45:44.533 --> 00:45:48.037
He be outside,
whining to get in.

00:45:48.204 --> 00:45:50.206
Let him whine.

00:45:50.373 --> 00:45:52.421
Aye, sir.

00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:54.881
But he be clean,
he ain't got no crawlers.

00:45:55.044 --> 00:45:56.261
All dogs have crawlers.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.297
I'll have none of them
in my house.

00:45:58.464 --> 00:46:00.091
Now go do as I bid you.

00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:34.978
Ross!

00:47:35.144 --> 00:47:36.316
I wasn't expecting...

00:47:36.479 --> 00:47:38.197
ls my uncle in?

00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:07.977
Did you enjoy market day?

00:48:08.135 --> 00:48:10.888
What time will my uncle be back?

00:48:12.431 --> 00:48:13.899
You caused quite a stir.

00:48:14.058 --> 00:48:16.857
Though not everyone
appreciated your intervention.

00:48:17.019 --> 00:48:19.738
The child did.

00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:22.195
She got home safely?

00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:25.487
I thought to employ the girl,
as a kitchen maid.

00:48:25.653 --> 00:48:28.327
Her family appear
to care little for her.

00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:30.583
You should send her back
to them.

00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:32.118
People are quick to judge.

00:48:32.284 --> 00:48:33.661
Are you?

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:39.167
I shouldn't have come.

00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:41.677
I can see it upsets you.

00:48:41.836 --> 00:48:43.258
Ross, it's not your coming here.

00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:44.673
What, then?

00:48:44.839 --> 00:48:48.059
It hurts to think
how you must hate me.

00:48:49.385 --> 00:48:51.854
Good God, Elizabeth,

00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:53.855
you of all people should know.

00:48:55.391 --> 00:49:00.147
From the moment I set eyes
on you, no one else existed.

00:49:00.312 --> 00:49:02.314
While I was away,
all I could think about

00:49:02.481 --> 00:49:04.199
was coming back to you.
Ross...

00:49:04.358 --> 00:49:06.577
Did we really not mean
those things we said?

00:49:06.735 --> 00:49:11.536
That day I left, was there
really nothing between us?

00:49:11.699 --> 00:49:14.418
Is there really nothing
between us now?

00:49:14.577 --> 00:49:15.954
I thought you were dead!

00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:19.833
How can you come to me now
and ask me things

00:49:19.999 --> 00:49:21.091
you know I can't answer?

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.378
Why can't you answer?

00:49:23.544 --> 00:49:26.423
(loudly):
Why can't you answer?

00:49:35.139 --> 00:49:38.643
There's nothing
for you here, Ross.

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:41.608
I love Francis.

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.740
You must forget me
and make your life elsewhere.

00:49:50.863 --> 00:49:54.242
You may rely upon it.

00:50:09.757 --> 00:50:11.759
At least let us
part as friends.

00:50:11.926 --> 00:50:14.020
We can never be friends.

00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:15.304
Tell my uncle he has his wish.

00:50:15.471 --> 00:50:16.848
What wish?

00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:18.607
Ross!

00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:19.858
What wish?!

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:45.217
Tell the girl to fetch
her belongings.

00:50:45.376 --> 00:50:46.468
Eh?
She's leaving.

00:50:46.627 --> 00:50:47.719
Leaving?
As am I.

00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:48.970
You, sir?

00:50:49.129 --> 00:50:50.221
To London, she to her father.

00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:52.224
But her father's here.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.403
What can I do for you?

00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:11.698
What can you do?

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:15.330
When you've slocked my daughter
and enticed her away.

00:51:15.489 --> 00:51:17.412
Where is she?

00:51:17.575 --> 00:51:18.451
No idea.

00:51:18.617 --> 00:51:19.493
They searched the house.

00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:22.542
By whose permission?

00:51:22.705 --> 00:51:25.049
I need no permission
to come after me own!

00:51:25.207 --> 00:51:26.208
That's why you bring
your family?

00:51:26.375 --> 00:51:28.218
Not man enough to do
the job yourself?

00:51:28.377 --> 00:51:29.720
I brought more than we!

00:51:40.639 --> 00:51:41.561
So you can take her home
and beat her?

00:51:41.724 --> 00:51:42.896
Is that your business?

00:51:43.058 --> 00:51:44.401
If I choose to make it so.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.812
All right, boys!

00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:50.608
Sir, they be hordes
of them!

00:51:54.737 --> 00:51:55.784
llluggan folk don't hold
with thieving.

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.368
We come for justice.

00:51:57.531 --> 00:51:59.533
An army against one man?

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.247
That's brave!

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:02.002
Afeared, are ye?

00:52:02.161 --> 00:52:03.253
On the contrary.

00:52:03.412 --> 00:52:06.291
You couldn't have come
at a better time!

00:52:06.457 --> 00:52:07.333
Lord save him!

00:52:07.499 --> 00:52:09.342
Nay, stand off, boys.

00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:11.549
I'll handle this myself.

00:52:28.604 --> 00:52:30.481
What business have ye here?

00:52:30.648 --> 00:52:32.150
Naught with ye,
but with your fancy gent

00:52:32.316 --> 00:52:33.408
who stole a llluggan maid!

00:52:33.567 --> 00:52:35.444
And we're here
to take her back!

00:52:37.696 --> 00:52:38.788
Good luck to you!

00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:08.481
(panting):
Mr. Francis!

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:11.818
Mr. Francis!

00:53:13.691 --> 00:53:15.989
They be killing Mr. Ross!

00:53:23.826 --> 00:53:25.794
What the devil
are you saying, woman?

00:53:25.953 --> 00:53:27.671
(panting):
They be murdering him, sir.

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:30.458
Mr. Ross be fighting
for his life.

00:53:30.624 --> 00:53:32.217
You must go to him, Francis,
you must help him.

00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:33.753
The woman exaggerates.

00:53:33.919 --> 00:53:34.795
For pity's sake!

00:53:34.962 --> 00:53:36.134
Take Elizabeth inside.

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:25.850
Be so good <i>as</i> to close the door
on your way out.

00:55:09.515 --> 00:55:11.108
(breathless):
Ye be alive, sir!

00:55:12.684 --> 00:55:16.029
It would appear so.

00:55:16.188 --> 00:55:17.940
Any sign of the girl?

00:55:18.106 --> 00:55:19.904
I ain't seen her
since God knows when.

00:55:20.067 --> 00:55:23.662
(panting):
Happen she run away, sir.

00:55:25.239 --> 00:55:26.957
Happen it be
for the best, sir.

00:55:27.115 --> 00:55:29.413
I'm inclined to agree with you.

00:55:29.576 --> 00:55:32.750
She appears to be more trouble
than she's worth.

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:44.132
Where's Jud?

00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:46.142
Gone to fight
the Illuggan miners, sir.

00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:49.430
Happen he be dead himself
'fore long.

00:55:49.596 --> 00:55:52.520
And I left a widow,

00:55:52.683 --> 00:55:53.775
all forlorn.

00:56:13.453 --> 00:56:15.171
You heard him.

00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:17.082
He don't want thee here.

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:26.009
"More trouble
than she's worth"?

00:56:26.174 --> 00:56:27.767
His words, not mine.

00:56:29.553 --> 00:56:30.679
Now hop it, girl.

00:56:30.846 --> 00:56:32.473
Back where ye belong.

00:56:46.445 --> 00:56:48.868
In God's name, what happened?

00:56:51.158 --> 00:56:53.581
CHARLES:
Francis!

00:56:57.956 --> 00:57:02.962
They'll not thank him for
dragging them into his folly.

00:57:03.128 --> 00:57:06.723
Which gives him even
less reason to stay.

00:57:06.882 --> 00:57:08.509
He means to leave?

00:57:08.675 --> 00:57:10.803
He's been invited to leave.

00:57:12.888 --> 00:57:14.481
What have you done, Father?

00:57:17.184 --> 00:57:20.529
They'll be nursing their bruises
till next back-end!

00:57:20.687 --> 00:57:22.689
So you leave me at home
to dispatch one man,

00:57:22.856 --> 00:57:25.029
while you treat yourselves
to a full-scale brawl?

00:57:25.192 --> 00:57:26.944
Aye, sir,
that's the truth of it, sir.

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:28.202
It won't
happen again.

00:57:28.362 --> 00:57:29.864
Don't say that!

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:32.203
Quarrels of my own making
I'll fight my own way,

00:57:32.366 --> 00:57:33.458
you understand?

00:57:33.617 --> 00:57:34.618
It was a matter of pride.

00:57:34.785 --> 00:57:35.877
Nay, of personal affront.

00:57:36.036 --> 00:57:37.458
The quarrel was mine.

00:57:37.621 --> 00:57:39.464
Nay, Ross,
friends don't stand by

00:57:39.623 --> 00:57:41.000
when one of their own's
at stake.

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:45.178
Come the day
Wheal Leisure's fit,

00:57:45.337 --> 00:57:46.884
she can count on us an' all.

00:58:09.653 --> 00:58:11.747
I don't like it, Father.

00:58:11.905 --> 00:58:14.704
You'd like it less
if you lost your wife.

00:58:14.866 --> 00:58:18.120
(scoffs): You're assuming
I can't keep her myself.

00:58:18.286 --> 00:58:19.913

What have you got

You're making a mistake.

00:59:18.638 --> 00:59:20.311
Am I?

00:59:20.474 --> 00:59:21.771
Your place is here.

00:59:21.933 --> 00:59:23.651
Your land, your mines.

00:59:24.936 --> 00:59:27.860
Are you asking me
to stay, Elizabeth?

00:59:28.023 --> 00:59:31.653
I'm saying that everything that
matters to you is in Cornwall.

00:59:31.818 --> 00:59:34.492
Where did you think
I was going?

00:59:34.654 --> 00:59:36.531
To London.

00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:38.325
Your uncle said...

00:59:38.492 --> 00:59:39.869
My uncle is mistaken.

00:59:41.203 --> 00:59:42.671
Then what are you doing?

00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:45.673
I lost sight of something.

00:59:45.832 --> 00:59:47.880
I came in search of it.

00:59:48.043 --> 00:59:50.717
Having found it,
I'm going home.

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:14.990
DEMELZA:
What's that to you?

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:17.956
My inheritance.
