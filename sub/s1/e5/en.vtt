00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:04.105
Captain Poldark.

00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:07.785
Dr Enys! You survived the journey?

00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:10.185
Missed the riots in London,
but caught them in Exeter!

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:12.145
We're uncivilized here,
let me warn you.

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:13.345
I've seen worse.

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:15.425
You've saved worse!
Come meet my friends.

00:02:15.475 --> 00:02:18.105
Paul, Zacky, Mark,
this is Dwight Enys.

00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:19.945
I have him to thank
for patching me up!

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:21.825
I trust my skill's
improved since then.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.065
Dwight is here to make
a study of mine diseases.

00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:25.865
There's no shortage of subjects!

00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:27.745
Do you suffer yourself?

00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:29.425
Heart and lungs of an ox!

00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:32.025
Then I hope we'll have no call
to meet, except socially.

00:02:32.075 --> 00:02:34.415
You must come meet my wife.

00:02:58.035 --> 00:03:00.865
- Demelza, my friend, Dr Dwight Enys.
- Ma'am.

00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:02.985
'Twas you that mended his face?

00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:04.425
Your fame precedes you, sir!

00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:06.475
My infamy, you mean!

00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:11.115
I intend to keep my head down here.
I've no wish to become notorious.

00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:22.035
Roll up!

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.366
A picture of conjugal bliss!

00:03:31.092 --> 00:03:33.443
Make the most of it,
while you still can!

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:35.533
You look well.

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.023
Oh! A month to go and I'm
already fatter than Prudie!

00:03:40.312 --> 00:03:42.657
If in doubt, purge. That's our motto.

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:45.215
Bleed, boil, blister, sweat.

00:03:45.916 --> 00:03:48.148
Healing is a... a science, ma'am.

00:03:48.986 --> 00:03:51.510
- Few comprehend its mysteries.
- Or its fees.

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.144
I merely meant not everyone can
afford expensive treatments.

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.495
And sometimes does it not do better
to work with nature's remedies?

00:04:01.678 --> 00:04:03.715
- And you are...?
- Dr Dwight Enys.

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:05.659
He's here to make a study
of mine diseases.

00:04:05.784 --> 00:04:07.115
He's come to the right place.

00:04:07.425 --> 00:04:08.731
Not if he cares to eat.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.694
The only cases are miners,
and they rarely pay.

00:04:13.097 --> 00:04:15.036
I wonder if healing
is not its own reward?

00:04:15.508 --> 00:04:18.046
When you're living under a
hedge and dining off thistles,

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.470
perhaps you'll care to revisit
that question, sir.

00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:29.983
How's Grambler?

00:04:29.984 --> 00:04:32.771
Mortgaged to the hilt,
running out of ore,

00:04:33.227 --> 00:04:34.528
the price of copper tumbling.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.321
Perhaps we'll all be sleeping
under hedges soon!

00:04:41.587 --> 00:04:43.393
Stop playing with him, Mark. Come on!

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:53.251
I am undone,

00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:55.876
there be no living,

00:04:56.782 --> 00:04:57.782
none,

00:04:58.184 --> 00:04:59.292
if Bertram be away.

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:05.770
'Twere all one that I should
love a bright particular star

00:05:05.922 --> 00:05:07.075
and think to wed it.

00:05:10.885 --> 00:05:13.535
He is so above me.

00:05:14.977 --> 00:05:18.611
In his bright radiance
and collateral light

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.644
must I be comforted,
not in his sphere...

00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:28.566
My love?

00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:30.081
It's just an ache.

00:05:32.134 --> 00:05:33.787
I'll maybe stretch my legs awhile.

00:06:02.183 --> 00:06:03.183
Back so soon?

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:14.355
Oh, I hate to see your pain, my dear.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.022
I hate to see yours.

00:06:20.057 --> 00:06:21.057
Get the linen.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.848
I could prescribe a remedy.

00:06:24.332 --> 00:06:26.137
One that lives near Truro
and captains a ship.

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:30.019
I never think of him, Demelza.
I pray you do likewise.

00:06:31.645 --> 00:06:33.400
I must have something to divert me!

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:36.726
Ah, Judas!

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:40.918
Where's that brandy wine?

00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:47.835
Perhaps we should go upstairs.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.612
All yet seems well

00:06:56.575 --> 00:06:57.887
and if it end so meet,

00:06:59.465 --> 00:07:00.465
the bitter past,

00:07:01.594 --> 00:07:04.019
and more welcome is the sweet.

00:07:13.582 --> 00:07:15.448
Should we expect an
announcement soon?

00:07:16.118 --> 00:07:18.498
You may soon find you've
an announcement of your own.

00:07:56.334 --> 00:07:58.621
How did we make something so perfect?

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.250
I am afeared, Ross,

00:08:04.604 --> 00:08:05.805
that I love her too much.

00:08:07.597 --> 00:08:09.357
It will hurt so much
more if things go amiss.

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:13.025
I promise you...

00:08:14.854 --> 00:08:17.105
I will make the world
a better place for her.

00:08:20.587 --> 00:08:22.380
I will be a better man for her sake.

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:24.252
And for me?

00:08:27.489 --> 00:08:29.950
I'm already a better
man because of you.

00:09:10.067 --> 00:09:11.592
Ross and Demelza have a daughter.

00:09:16.914 --> 00:09:17.914
I wish them well.

00:09:48.297 --> 00:09:50.719
'Tis Mistress Poldark from Trenwith.

00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:52.199
Please, don't get up.

00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:57.942
Ross ain't here and Julia's sleeping.

00:09:58.602 --> 00:09:59.928
'Tis you I came to see.

00:10:01.152 --> 00:10:02.152
I?

00:10:03.124 --> 00:10:04.124
Er... some refreshment.

00:10:04.636 --> 00:10:06.363
I beg you, do not trouble yourself.

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:19.852
That's very pretty.

00:10:21.304 --> 00:10:24.496
Oh, it's just a fancy I had,
to make her a keepsake.

00:10:26.097 --> 00:10:28.438
I know it is not made
of gold, or silver.

00:10:29.872 --> 00:10:30.872
Or even copper!

00:10:32.348 --> 00:10:33.828
It's made of something more precious.

00:10:35.972 --> 00:10:39.300
A mother's love for her child
surpasses all other loves,

00:10:39.812 --> 00:10:40.812
does it not?

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.376
I'm not sure Ross would
care to hear that!

00:10:46.497 --> 00:10:47.497
Nor Francis!

00:10:49.843 --> 00:10:51.554
Men do not understand such things.

00:10:57.379 --> 00:10:58.821
'Julia Grace Poldark, '

00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:03.268
I baptize thee in the
name of the Father,

00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:05.711
and of the Son...

00:11:07.776 --> 00:11:09.186
and of the Holy Ghost.

00:11:10.264 --> 00:11:11.264
Amen.

00:11:12.111 --> 00:11:13.111
Amen.

00:11:24.625 --> 00:11:25.731
Congratulations, Ross.

00:11:27.619 --> 00:11:28.847
This is Ross's doing!

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.512
I said I wanted two christenings,
one for his sort and one for mine.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.273
And where do I fit in?

00:11:34.776 --> 00:11:36.381
You fit in everywhere.
You are like Ross.

00:11:38.734 --> 00:11:39.734
Whereas I...

00:11:41.366 --> 00:11:42.469
I can scarce breathe.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.470
What's there to fear?

00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:46.008
That my stays are so
tight they'll burst?

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.853
I'm surprised Captain Poldark allows
such riffraff in his house.

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:54.426
But perhaps he's been obliged
to lower his standards of late.

00:12:00.446 --> 00:12:01.640
Getting much sleep, Ross?

00:12:02.479 --> 00:12:03.920
I've no complaints.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.842
A child changes everything.

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:08.466
So does owning a mine.
Neither can be ignored.

00:12:08.932 --> 00:12:09.932
Much as one tries!

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:14.489
My wife is perfection, is she not?

00:12:15.928 --> 00:12:17.488
God knows what I've
done to deserve her.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.074
The curse of the Poldarks.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.178
Once given, our hearts
are not easily withdrawn.

00:12:33.175 --> 00:12:34.191
They're very different.

00:12:35.601 --> 00:12:36.601
Yes.

00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:39.585
Yet each has something
the other lacks.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.231
Perhaps you'd like them both(?)

00:12:42.218 --> 00:12:43.218
Perhaps I would!

00:12:59.727 --> 00:13:00.727
I envy you.

00:13:02.402 --> 00:13:03.659
My charmed life?

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:04.799
Is it not charmed?

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:10.121
Has it not comfort and
purpose and certainty?

00:13:11.229 --> 00:13:13.999
This is Cornwall, Dwight.
Nothing is certain!

00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:20.142
As we feared. Choake sold
his shares in Leisure.

00:13:21.049 --> 00:13:22.049
To whom?

00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:24.879
(Oh, damn!)

00:13:25.245 --> 00:13:27.445
- Your health and prosperity, Ross!
- And yours, George,

00:13:28.232 --> 00:13:31.295
particularly in the light
of your recent acquisition.

00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:34.556
Ah, my shares in Wheal Leisure? You
must take that as a compliment.

00:13:34.867 --> 00:13:37.934
Oh, I do. Clearly you know a
fine investment when you see it!

00:13:42.153 --> 00:13:43.505
What of the other shareholders?

00:13:44.271 --> 00:13:45.673
Two or three more wish to sell.

00:13:46.633 --> 00:13:47.633
We must buy them out.

00:13:47.763 --> 00:13:49.893
- How?
- No idea.

00:13:51.334 --> 00:13:53.975
But I'll starve before I see another
piece of Leisure in his hands.

00:13:59.502 --> 00:14:01.490
Has Ruth Treneglos finished
dissecting me?

00:14:03.428 --> 00:14:06.642
Don't mind her, dear. She
cannot spoil a splendid day.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.780
Oh, Verity!

00:14:12.646 --> 00:14:14.360
I wish you could have this, too.

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:16.987
Don't waste another moment
on such thoughts.

00:14:21.271 --> 00:14:23.865
Who be this, then, just as
we run out o' likky pie?

00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:28.726
'Tis like a blathering
funeral procession!

00:14:33.118 --> 00:14:34.306
It can't be...

00:14:37.687 --> 00:14:38.737
Mr Carne!

00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:41.776
How do you do, sir?

00:14:43.726 --> 00:14:46.068
Mrs Carne, glad you were
able to join us, ma'am.

00:14:47.597 --> 00:14:48.597
This way.

00:14:59.672 --> 00:15:01.383
Step no further, Nelly.

00:15:03.413 --> 00:15:06.166
This be a place of
filth and abomination.

00:15:08.251 --> 00:15:09.481
Shame on you, daughter...

00:15:10.954 --> 00:15:13.268
to mix with such dandical folk

00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:16.389
when your own flesh and blood
should take precedence.

00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:18.230
And so they shall, sir.

00:15:19.327 --> 00:15:21.526
Allow me to introduce you
to my friends and family,

00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:23.380
beginning with your granddaughter.

00:15:28.385 --> 00:15:29.648
This way, Mr Carne.

00:15:32.878 --> 00:15:36.190
My cousin Francis, my friends
John and Ruth Treneglos,

00:15:36.538 --> 00:15:37.538
Dr Dwight Enys.

00:15:38.754 --> 00:15:39.754
Your servant, sir.

00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:42.826
No servant o' mine!

00:15:44.237 --> 00:15:45.353
And no friend neither.

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:49.171
Cover yourself, missy!

00:15:50.479 --> 00:15:52.349
Your place is to be
decent and modest,

00:15:53.003 --> 00:15:56.855
not... laying out wares
for men to slaver over.

00:15:58.581 --> 00:15:59.956
Damn your insolence!

00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:02.517
John, did you hear what he said?

00:16:04.364 --> 00:16:05.700
You impudent swine!

00:16:06.102 --> 00:16:08.251
Make apology or I'll have
the coat off your back!

00:16:08.377 --> 00:16:12.022
Have a care, John. John,
you are both my guests

00:16:12.173 --> 00:16:14.278
and I couldn't permit you
to strike my father-in-law.

00:16:14.692 --> 00:16:15.692
Nay, let him come!

00:16:16.502 --> 00:16:18.824
I've been in the ring,
I can hold me own!

00:16:19.174 --> 00:16:20.374
Hold your tongue, sir!

00:16:20.775 --> 00:16:22.175
If we want your opinion, we'll ask.

00:16:22.349 --> 00:16:25.338
John, allow me, as host, to
apologise for any offence caused.

00:16:26.192 --> 00:16:28.930
Well... if Ruth is satisfied.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.510
Naturally, if Ross wishes to
protect his new relative...

00:16:35.633 --> 00:16:36.989
allowances should be made...

00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:39.606
for those who don't know any better.

00:16:53.249 --> 00:16:54.650
I thought the players had moved on?

00:16:55.617 --> 00:16:56.617
They had!

00:16:57.637 --> 00:16:59.272
She did tell me she'd return.

00:17:00.768 --> 00:17:01.977
I never thought she would!

00:17:02.648 --> 00:17:03.580
You must catch her while you can.

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:04.956
I mean to.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.802
- Keren!
- Like a lamb to the slaughter.

00:17:17.372 --> 00:17:18.404
They've gone.

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:19.939
And good riddance!

00:17:20.074 --> 00:17:21.317
Blasted hypocrites!

00:17:21.612 --> 00:17:22.638
Why did they come?

00:17:23.463 --> 00:17:24.577
Because I invited them.

00:17:25.787 --> 00:17:27.321
They meant to shame and disgrace me.

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.217
Well, they failed.

00:17:29.366 --> 00:17:30.647
In a week it will all be forgot.

00:17:32.925 --> 00:17:33.925
Not by me.

00:17:47.605 --> 00:17:48.605
I did miss 'ee.

00:17:49.896 --> 00:17:50.896
How much?

00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:52.759
I scarce did eat.

00:17:53.228 --> 00:17:54.228
They all say that.

00:17:56.788 --> 00:17:59.669
I can't stay here long and
tomorrow I shall be gone.

00:18:00.709 --> 00:18:01.709
And when return?

00:18:02.589 --> 00:18:03.589
Happen I shan't.

00:18:04.975 --> 00:18:05.975
Not ever?

00:18:06.493 --> 00:18:07.798
What's to keep me here?

00:18:15.026 --> 00:18:17.852
Find her a home? Within a week?

00:18:18.466 --> 00:18:19.892
How? Why?

00:18:20.477 --> 00:18:22.564
It's the condition of her
agreeing to marry him.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.038
Well, you could help them.
There's a cottage at Mellin.

00:18:28.857 --> 00:18:30.138
It's in no fit state to live in.

00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:32.088
Does she love him?

00:18:32.638 --> 00:18:33.638
She says so.

00:18:33.753 --> 00:18:34.753
Does he love her?

00:18:35.628 --> 00:18:36.628
Besotted.

00:18:41.448 --> 00:18:42.548
Then they should marry.

00:18:44.426 --> 00:18:45.426
Because?

00:18:46.577 --> 00:18:47.796
Love SHOULD conquer all.

00:18:49.408 --> 00:18:50.769
Even if it requires a little help.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
On the contrary!

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.635
Some obstacles cannot be overcome...

00:18:56.572 --> 00:18:58.694
and should not, for the
peace of all concerned.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.877
He would have enjoyed today.

00:19:19.313 --> 00:19:20.788
He'd have revelled in it.

00:19:23.275 --> 00:19:25.997
The great... patriarch
and leader of men!

00:19:27.648 --> 00:19:28.990
Is that to be disdained?

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.443
It's... to be lived up to.

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:36.102
And can you not?

00:19:42.663 --> 00:19:44.191
It was a question, not a judgment.

00:20:11.229 --> 00:20:12.394
Shall Papa read to you now?

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:18.962
Papa... has business
to attend to in town.

00:20:36.284 --> 00:20:37.284
Will you be gone long?

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:41.437
As long as it takes to raise capital
to buy out our nervous shareholders.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:00.898
Are you ready?

00:21:01.142 --> 00:21:03.082
Well, pick me liver! What's
the blatherin' rush?

00:21:03.666 --> 00:21:05.821
Sneakin' an' slidin'
an' slitherin' about -

00:21:06.085 --> 00:21:07.725
'tedn't right, 'tedn't
fit, tedn't proper.

00:21:07.881 --> 00:21:10.660
We must be done and back by
five or Julia will suffer.

00:21:12.003 --> 00:21:13.003
Let's get gone.

00:21:30.044 --> 00:21:31.044
Thank you, sir!

00:21:41.457 --> 00:21:42.497
'What brings you to town?'

00:21:43.388 --> 00:21:44.388
Insane optimism?

00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:48.429
The fond hope that my banker
can drum up sufficient capital

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.030
to buy out our
discontented shareholders.

00:21:51.094 --> 00:21:53.230
- Before selling to the Warleggans.
- I wish you well.

00:21:54.662 --> 00:21:55.931
Let us change the subject.

00:21:55.932 --> 00:21:58.052
By all means. Did you hear
of the riots in Launceston?

00:21:59.273 --> 00:22:00.273
Are you surprised?

00:22:01.449 --> 00:22:03.730
People can only starve for so
long while the rich get fat.

00:22:04.185 --> 00:22:06.786
In France, they make their feelings
known with hatchets and pikes.

00:22:07.341 --> 00:22:08.548
They may do so here, soon.

00:22:09.455 --> 00:22:11.163
Copper prices have fallen again.

00:22:11.995 --> 00:22:13.809
God knows when Grambler
last paid full wages.

00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:16.432
The industry's on its knees.

00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:18.569
What's to be done?

00:22:19.239 --> 00:22:21.390
Sit tight and wait
for the price to rise.

00:22:39.323 --> 00:22:40.323
Thank you.

00:22:57.038 --> 00:22:59.870
We're all committed to
short-term loan repayments.

00:23:00.126 --> 00:23:01.886
If we don't sell cheap,
we don't sell at all.

00:23:03.361 --> 00:23:05.601
Of course, if the smelting
companies were honestly run...

00:23:06.202 --> 00:23:07.202
Are they not?

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.767
It's a ring. They don't
bid against each other

00:23:10.148 --> 00:23:11.708
so the price they pay
us is rock-bottom.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.700
A pity the mines are
not in similar unity.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.987
We could band together

00:23:16.988 --> 00:23:18.989
and withhold supplies till
a decent price was paid.

00:23:19.125 --> 00:23:21.069
No remedy, then?

00:23:21.246 --> 00:23:23.327
Unless the mines were to
form a company of their own,

00:23:24.406 --> 00:23:27.178
bid independently, purchase
ore, extract the copper,

00:23:27.915 --> 00:23:28.915
build a smelting works.

00:23:29.833 --> 00:23:31.354
That would keep the
shareholders happy.

00:23:31.447 --> 00:23:33.119
I couldn't help but overhear.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.477
You intend to form
a smelting company?

00:23:36.927 --> 00:23:38.157
I intend nothing, sir.

00:23:39.373 --> 00:23:42.417
I merely say that WERE the mines
to unite and create a company -

00:23:43.103 --> 00:23:46.852
one that would bid, buy, refine
and sell their own products -

00:23:47.183 --> 00:23:48.784
they might keep the
profit for themselves

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:51.419
instead of handing
it to the Warleggans.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:57.719
(Absolute genius!)

00:24:12.398 --> 00:24:13.851
May I be of service to you, ma'am?

00:24:15.412 --> 00:24:16.599
My name is Poldark.

00:24:20.084 --> 00:24:21.371
Did Verity send you?

00:24:22.741 --> 00:24:25.443
No. She's no idea I've come.

00:24:26.274 --> 00:24:27.274
No-one does.

00:24:30.157 --> 00:24:32.278
It was made clear long ago
that Verity was not for me.

00:24:33.018 --> 00:24:35.607
I've since moved on,
set my sights elsewhere.

00:24:37.316 --> 00:24:38.316
You're married?

00:24:38.366 --> 00:24:39.366
To my ship.

00:24:40.924 --> 00:24:41.924
To my profession.

00:24:43.558 --> 00:24:44.599
And all the better for it.

00:24:44.878 --> 00:24:46.279
- But...
- I never think of her now!

00:24:50.797 --> 00:24:52.446
I'm sorry you've had
a wasted journey.

00:25:25.422 --> 00:25:27.919
If you wish to raise money
to buy out your shareholders,

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.531
you have only one option -

00:25:33.087 --> 00:25:34.947
raise a mortgage on Nampara.

00:25:37.207 --> 00:25:39.054
And risk the very roof over my head.

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:41.211
And with a wife and young
child to support.

00:25:41.403 --> 00:25:42.403
You'd advise against.

00:25:42.521 --> 00:25:43.737
Most emphatically.

00:25:55.296 --> 00:25:56.296
A good day?

00:25:56.858 --> 00:25:58.032
A frustrating day.

00:26:01.483 --> 00:26:02.862
At least Julia's content.

00:26:04.938 --> 00:26:05.938
She is.

00:26:06.971 --> 00:26:09.742
But you seem very confined
here. Can you bear it?

00:26:11.407 --> 00:26:12.663
I find it suits me well enough.

00:26:13.003 --> 00:26:14.523
Mark Daniel's just
sent for 'ee, Cap'n.

00:26:18.228 --> 00:26:19.242
It seems to be catching.

00:26:20.229 --> 00:26:21.229
- What?
- Recklessness.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.573
She's a fortunate girl.

00:26:29.964 --> 00:26:31.064
A plaguey demandin' one!

00:26:31.653 --> 00:26:33.341
What kind of woman
makes such conditions?

00:26:33.765 --> 00:26:35.360
Happen she never thought he'd do it.

00:26:35.734 --> 00:26:37.015
Well, she don't know Mark, then.

00:26:37.605 --> 00:26:39.068
Looks like you are making progress.

00:26:40.287 --> 00:26:41.707
No sleep for four nights!

00:26:43.403 --> 00:26:45.312
And you're set on this girl, Mark?

00:26:46.947 --> 00:26:48.507
- You barely know her.
- Maybe so, Ross,

00:26:49.926 --> 00:26:51.427
but truly she is my heart's desire.

00:26:53.186 --> 00:26:54.558
I hope she deserves you.

00:27:09.182 --> 00:27:10.182
They don't like her.

00:27:11.164 --> 00:27:13.441
They like Mark. She's an outsider.

00:27:14.488 --> 00:27:15.488
So am I.

00:27:16.307 --> 00:27:19.341
They like me. They make
allowances for you!

00:27:33.683 --> 00:27:34.683
Is that it?!

00:27:34.745 --> 00:27:35.745
Yes.

00:27:36.824 --> 00:27:37.824
Oh.

00:27:40.308 --> 00:27:43.599
We'll make it fit 'ee, Keren. It
will soon be a palace, you'll see.

00:28:06.238 --> 00:28:07.631
I've secured lodgings for you.

00:28:08.229 --> 00:28:09.335
That's tremendous. Where?

00:28:09.895 --> 00:28:13.689
Mingoose Cottage. It's not
grand, but I hope it'll serve.

00:28:13.956 --> 00:28:15.564
It will serve me...

00:28:15.821 --> 00:28:17.110
to know who my neighbour is!

00:28:17.582 --> 00:28:19.245
Have you been introduced
to the bride?

00:28:19.472 --> 00:28:21.512
If he'd dance with her, she
might introduce herself.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.454
Oh, er, at your service, ma'am.

00:28:35.282 --> 00:28:36.402
I've been thinking, Ross.

00:28:37.336 --> 00:28:41.200
Keren, she do have finer tastes
than I can easy stretch to.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:44.810
Yes?

00:28:45.514 --> 00:28:49.024
So could 'ee maybe find
me extra work at the mine?

00:28:50.778 --> 00:28:51.882
I'd like to say yes, Mark.

00:28:53.796 --> 00:28:55.836
But it depends on how we
fare in tomorrow's auction.

00:29:05.085 --> 00:29:06.085
So, there you have it.

00:29:07.178 --> 00:29:08.626
The copper auction is tomorrow.

00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:12.616
As usual, the price will be fixed
by the smelting companies.

00:29:13.729 --> 00:29:16.388
And I've no means to
buy out our shareholders

00:29:16.785 --> 00:29:17.906
without risking all we have.

00:29:20.023 --> 00:29:21.023
This house, our land...

00:29:23.464 --> 00:29:24.545
our very livelihood.

00:29:27.973 --> 00:29:31.384
You must be regretting your marriage
to such a destitute rogue!

00:29:32.775 --> 00:29:33.917
Must I?

00:29:36.022 --> 00:29:37.748
After what you brought me to?

00:29:38.986 --> 00:29:40.313
Am I now such a great lady

00:29:40.632 --> 00:29:42.352
as to forget where I'd
be if we'd never met?

00:29:44.687 --> 00:29:45.687
What?

00:29:46.644 --> 00:29:47.644
Women.

00:29:48.958 --> 00:29:49.958
None are created equal.

00:29:52.554 --> 00:29:55.605
Some... are never satisfied.

00:29:57.412 --> 00:29:59.246
Some could never be brought so low.

00:30:01.278 --> 00:30:05.033
And others thumb their nose at adversity
and roll up their sleeves!

00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:08.989
Perhaps you wish you'd
married a rich lady?!

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:11.548
I'm quite aware of my good
fortune, I assure you.

00:30:16.175 --> 00:30:18.260
Shall we ask Papa how
much copper we sent?

00:30:19.273 --> 00:30:20.879
- "We"?
- Our mine.

00:30:21.782 --> 00:30:24.032
Grambler... to the auction.

00:30:24.755 --> 00:30:26.247
One parcel or two?

00:30:26.548 --> 00:30:28.371
Mama's becoming quite the expert.

00:30:30.273 --> 00:30:33.748
- We must hope for a good price.
- Though we know we shan't get it!

00:30:35.326 --> 00:30:36.911
And unless the price goes sky-high,

00:30:38.564 --> 00:30:40.831
Papa will have to start
pawning the family jewels.

00:30:41.602 --> 00:30:42.602
Francis...

00:30:42.853 --> 00:30:44.453
Perhaps someone will
make a bid for Mama.

00:31:11.503 --> 00:31:14.117
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
The auction is now open.

00:31:16.198 --> 00:31:18.874
I have first to dispose of
a dole of ore from Grambler.

00:31:19.808 --> 00:31:21.190
45 tonnes.

00:31:23.616 --> 00:31:26.574
- Disastrous. - A scandal.
- Disgrace!

00:31:26.983 --> 00:31:28.942
Every single parcel gone
for half its true value.

00:31:29.474 --> 00:31:31.528
We'll be paying them
to take it off us next.

00:31:33.916 --> 00:31:36.650
You realise you've been uncommonly
dull since you became a father?

00:31:37.768 --> 00:31:40.870
- My apologies.
- No matter, I've a remedy.

00:31:41.595 --> 00:31:43.596
Seeing what little entertainment
your life affords,

00:31:43.698 --> 00:31:45.058
I have procured you an invitation.

00:31:46.099 --> 00:31:47.580
- To what?
- The ultimate house party.

00:31:48.839 --> 00:31:51.279
- And if that doesn't put a smile on your face...
- Gentlemen.

00:31:52.624 --> 00:31:55.433
I take it you feel no satisfaction
at the business done today?

00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:56.679
Who the devil could?

00:31:57.464 --> 00:31:59.425
Then, may I trouble you
to step this way a moment?

00:32:06.924 --> 00:32:09.872
We'd like your word that nothing
that passes between us

00:32:10.878 --> 00:32:11.878
goes any further.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.170
Jinny... put the tetty pie to cool.
I'll walk out to meet Ross.

00:32:33.886 --> 00:32:34.886
'A smelting company?'

00:32:35.648 --> 00:32:36.998
Run by the mines themselves?

00:32:41.142 --> 00:32:42.502
Well, it all rings very agreeable,

00:32:42.812 --> 00:32:43.998
but you'd be biting
off no end of trouble.

00:32:44.277 --> 00:32:46.998
We know that, sir. The smelting
companies will want no competition.

00:32:47.827 --> 00:32:50.622
- And the Warleggans will be behind 'em.
- But all of us here

00:32:51.787 --> 00:32:55.756
are willing to stand together
and some of us can lay our hands

00:32:56.116 --> 00:32:59.187
- on a measure of cash.
- But it requires secrecy.

00:32:59.985 --> 00:33:02.907
So before we proceed,
who wishes to join us?

00:33:09.763 --> 00:33:12.499
What do you say, Ross?
Too risky a venture?

00:33:13.577 --> 00:33:15.311
It was your cousin who
first suggested it.

00:33:16.227 --> 00:33:17.227
Did he?

00:33:18.419 --> 00:33:20.046
We can't go on as we are.

00:33:21.552 --> 00:33:23.967
And I would rather fail fighting,
than throw up my hands

00:33:24.218 --> 00:33:25.218
and wait for the end.

00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:27.847
And Mr Francis Poldark?

00:33:30.387 --> 00:33:36.751
My finances are, at present...
somewhat complicated.

00:33:40.265 --> 00:33:42.931
So, I cannot, at this time, join you.

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:44.567
But I wish you well...

00:33:46.061 --> 00:33:47.519
Gentlemen. I do, indeed.

00:33:52.642 --> 00:33:55.758
And who is to be your leader?
Is it you, Tonkin?

00:33:57.453 --> 00:33:59.094
Oh, no, sir. I'm not
at all the right man,

00:33:59.938 --> 00:34:01.179
but we're all agreed on who is.

00:34:10.453 --> 00:34:11.453
A house party!

00:34:12.256 --> 00:34:13.422
At George Warleggan's.

00:34:14.587 --> 00:34:16.086
Think of that, my lamb.

00:34:17.128 --> 00:34:19.734
Your mother's a lady,
your father's a gent.

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:24.520
His name goes back hundreds of
years and a good name it is.

00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:29.914
Mistress Poldark! Forgive me,
I don't mean to alarm you,

00:34:30.223 --> 00:34:31.223
but I must speak.

00:34:36.082 --> 00:34:37.082
Good news or bad?

00:34:38.456 --> 00:34:41.273
Both. The auction was dismal, but...

00:34:41.674 --> 00:34:42.674
I still have a job?

00:34:43.632 --> 00:34:44.781
And I have a new one.

00:34:48.061 --> 00:34:51.029
I was unmannerly. I'm
a man of strong temper

00:34:52.445 --> 00:34:54.405
and to control it has been
the work of a lifetime,

00:34:54.565 --> 00:34:57.666
but God forbid that I should quarrel
with those who wish me well.

00:34:57.972 --> 00:35:00.686
- Captain Blamey, I cannot stay.
- Hear me out, I beg you.

00:35:02.813 --> 00:35:05.485
Since your visit, I
have been in turmoil.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.410
I thought that I had put
her behind me, but...

00:35:11.355 --> 00:35:12.456
I had not.

00:35:13.399 --> 00:35:16.499
- Mr Francis cannot be part of the new smelting company?
- Will not.

00:35:17.196 --> 00:35:18.757
Nor others who bank
with the Warleggans.

00:35:19.658 --> 00:35:22.018
If their names were known, George
would call in their debts.

00:35:22.699 --> 00:35:23.805
To a man, they'd be ruined.

00:35:25.063 --> 00:35:27.017
But I may have found a compromise.

00:35:27.426 --> 00:35:28.334
Those who bank with Warleggans

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.721
will keep their names secret.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.770
Those who bank elsewhere will
let their names be known.

00:35:33.799 --> 00:35:37.481
I bank with Pascoe, so
George cannot touch me.

00:35:39.251 --> 00:35:40.251
What do you want of me?

00:35:40.578 --> 00:35:43.472
To ask you... Am I to hope?

00:35:44.056 --> 00:35:46.619
With her father deceased,
do I have a chance?

00:35:48.104 --> 00:35:49.778
May I see her? How? When?

00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:53.116
I don't know. My husband,
he mustn't see you here.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.032
Is he against me, too?
He wasn't before.

00:35:56.375 --> 00:35:58.495
He's against me stirring up
what should be left alone.

00:36:00.986 --> 00:36:04.605
- He'll be on his way home soon. I must go.
- Will you tell Verity?

00:36:05.104 --> 00:36:08.750
No... I think, not yet.

00:36:10.713 --> 00:36:11.713
I'll send word.

00:36:12.432 --> 00:36:13.432
Bless you, ma'am.

00:36:15.578 --> 00:36:16.578
I will not fail you.

00:36:17.232 --> 00:36:18.232
Nor her.

00:36:40.214 --> 00:36:42.155
You seem excitable.
Is something amiss?

00:36:42.689 --> 00:36:44.093
Nothing, no.

00:36:45.029 --> 00:36:49.194
Only, a letter came, inviting
us to George Warleggan's party.

00:36:51.262 --> 00:36:54.012
I'm that glad! It'll make
up for the christening.

00:36:55.788 --> 00:36:59.202
Now I'll show that I
CAN wear fine clothes

00:37:00.201 --> 00:37:02.796
and behave all genteel, along
with the best of them.

00:37:03.206 --> 00:37:05.403
- That you will not.
- Why?

00:37:05.973 --> 00:37:07.093
It's not that kind of party.

00:37:08.781 --> 00:37:09.781
Oh.

00:37:12.024 --> 00:37:13.808
Oh, don't look so sorry for yourself.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.350
It'll be nothing but
gaming and toping

00:37:17.192 --> 00:37:18.767
and dawn-to-dusk business talk.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.340
Will you go, then?

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.014
If only to please Francis and
throw George off the scent

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:30.212
of my latest ventures, but
at least you can be spared.

00:38:17.577 --> 00:38:18.577
Going somewhere?

00:38:18.676 --> 00:38:19.797
Hmmm. To town.

00:38:21.709 --> 00:38:22.709
To what purpose?

00:38:23.996 --> 00:38:27.802
Urgent business. I need a new cloak
and Verity must help me choose.

00:38:29.045 --> 00:38:31.340
- What?
- The choosing of cloaks.

00:38:33.247 --> 00:38:35.872
May that always be the
worst of your worries!

00:38:36.326 --> 00:38:38.860
Now, don't delay me, I
have a party to attend.

00:38:39.455 --> 00:38:40.482
Jud! Bring the horses.

00:38:47.618 --> 00:38:49.068
You spoil me.

00:38:50.632 --> 00:38:51.278
Do you like it?

00:38:51.624 --> 00:38:52.920
I like to be appreciated.

00:38:54.723 --> 00:38:55.723
Who doesn't?

00:38:59.846 --> 00:39:01.339
Does your wife not appreciate you?

00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:07.246
My wife... tries to
make me a better man.

00:39:09.335 --> 00:39:10.622
Like your father?

00:39:13.711 --> 00:39:15.221
I will never be that man.

00:39:30.393 --> 00:39:31.713
Could you take me to Miss Verity?

00:39:31.984 --> 00:39:32.984
This way, ma'am.

00:39:43.304 --> 00:39:45.345
Are you joining this urgent
trip to the dressmakers?

00:39:45.836 --> 00:39:48.990
Because shopping and dressing
up are the only things of matter

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:51.959
- to us women? - Not at all.
- They are, of course,

00:39:52.765 --> 00:39:56.295
but I hesitate to buy ribbons when
our copper can scarce be given away.

00:39:57.732 --> 00:40:01.274
Besides, Francis has more
urgent calls on his purse.

00:40:02.073 --> 00:40:03.761
- Such as?
- Gaming,

00:40:04.485 --> 00:40:07.559
entertaining. Oh, himself,
not his wife. Nor his workers.

00:40:08.171 --> 00:40:10.745
They are not remotely entertained,
though I dare say she is,

00:40:11.502 --> 00:40:15.154
- lavishly.
- Elizabeth, I wish... - There was something you could do?

00:40:17.137 --> 00:40:19.021
Oh, I wish it, too, Ross.

00:40:19.731 --> 00:40:21.583
But we are beyond
wishing, are we not?

00:40:26.472 --> 00:40:27.927
Next time, I hope to join you.

00:41:31.827 --> 00:41:34.419
Were you not afraid?
The look in their eyes?

00:41:35.339 --> 00:41:36.379
I've seen the like before,

00:41:37.108 --> 00:41:38.856
in Luggan once, when
we were out of corn.

00:41:40.193 --> 00:41:41.873
Empty bellies make for such looks.

00:41:59.485 --> 00:42:01.682
And his grandfather was a blacksmith?

00:42:03.627 --> 00:42:04.815
How is it possible?

00:42:05.275 --> 00:42:07.462
To leap from poverty to
wealth in two generations?

00:42:07.803 --> 00:42:08.937
And maintain it in
the midst of a slump,

00:42:09.249 --> 00:42:11.157
while men like you
and Francis face ruin!

00:42:12.765 --> 00:42:14.366
We have different ways
of doing business.

00:42:23.711 --> 00:42:26.576
- Who is that?
- The infamous Matthew Sanson?

00:42:27.552 --> 00:42:30.184
- Mill owner and corn merchant.
- Does his infamy extend beyond

00:42:30.572 --> 00:42:31.700
bankrupting Francis?

00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:35.491
It extends almost everywhere
and he has George's endorsement,

00:42:35.751 --> 00:42:37.965
- which makes him...
- A force to be reckoned with. - A man of means,

00:42:38.294 --> 00:42:41.511
though, sadly, not of generosity.

00:42:43.284 --> 00:42:44.880
Is that collar not a gift of his?

00:42:45.118 --> 00:42:48.052
No, indeed. The giver
was a man of taste.

00:43:03.977 --> 00:43:06.177
Could you manage without me,
while I visit the chandler?

00:43:06.511 --> 00:43:08.290
On no account. You
must help me choose.

00:43:10.025 --> 00:43:13.707
What do you think of this
one? Or this one, perhaps?

00:43:21.307 --> 00:43:22.683
Miss Verity?

00:43:30.075 --> 00:43:31.572
A physician, sir?

00:43:33.093 --> 00:43:37.061
Pray, what do you
prescribe for boredom?

00:43:37.672 --> 00:43:39.393
It's not a condition
I'm familiar with, sir.

00:43:41.359 --> 00:43:44.344
Doubtless, you will have
opportunities to study it.

00:43:45.281 --> 00:43:47.061
I suspect not, sir.

00:43:47.963 --> 00:43:52.627
The patients I tend rarely suffer
from that affliction. Your health.

00:43:59.688 --> 00:44:03.448
A pity he hasn't your skill
at cards... or in other ways.

00:44:08.354 --> 00:44:12.416
- He'll shortly be ruined.
- And you will have done with him.

00:44:12.726 --> 00:44:14.144
As his wife did long ago.

00:44:16.874 --> 00:44:19.968
- Do all men come to regret their choice?
- I couldn't say.

00:44:20.957 --> 00:44:21.957
Do you?

00:44:24.085 --> 00:44:25.428
I regret nothing.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.855
Come the day, you know
where to find me.

00:44:31.189 --> 00:44:33.256
You was always my weakness, milord.

00:44:39.718 --> 00:44:43.502
For so long, I never dared to hope,
but such a chance as this...

00:44:43.676 --> 00:44:45.597
Captain Blamey, may I
introduce you to my cousin,

00:44:46.116 --> 00:44:48.071
Mistress Demelza Poldark,
Ross's wife.

00:44:49.751 --> 00:44:50.751
I'm honoured, ma'am.

00:44:51.142 --> 00:44:52.142
And I, sir.

00:44:54.147 --> 00:44:59.103
May I beg the pleasure of your company,
for a cordial or a coffee?

00:45:00.154 --> 00:45:01.211
- That would be...
- No!

00:45:03.775 --> 00:45:04.816
Thank you, sir. We cannot.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:08.775
No good can come of it.
I bid you good day.

00:45:35.458 --> 00:45:36.570
What are the stakes?

00:45:37.002 --> 00:45:38.842
- You wouldn't wish to know.
- On the contrary.

00:45:41.008 --> 00:45:42.378
You'll find out soon enough.

00:45:53.274 --> 00:45:54.725
Pray excuse me, gentlemen.

00:45:58.396 --> 00:46:01.649
A pleasure... as always.

00:46:19.637 --> 00:46:20.637
Get off!

00:46:36.161 --> 00:46:39.648
Verity... would it have been
so very bad to hear him out?

00:46:39.903 --> 00:46:42.528
- He can have nothing to say that I wish to hear.
- Nothing?

00:46:48.298 --> 00:46:49.576
Oh! Verity! Miners!

00:46:58.964 --> 00:47:01.004
Will you believe me if I
say it gives me no pleasure

00:47:01.056 --> 00:47:02.614
to see Francis beggar himself?

00:47:03.926 --> 00:47:04.939
Business is business.

00:47:05.468 --> 00:47:09.179
- It's not my business to bankrupt a friend.
- So you leave it

00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:11.390
to a third party and your
conscience is clear.

00:47:12.164 --> 00:47:13.519
I thank you for your hospitality.

00:47:25.045 --> 00:47:27.166
Miss Verity, I beg you, if
you would only hear me out.

00:47:27.475 --> 00:47:29.005
I cannot. I cannot!

00:47:43.249 --> 00:47:45.729
- These people should be flogged!
- Be careful, Mr Sanson, sir.

00:47:48.395 --> 00:47:52.021
Pay for it, damn you! 15 shillings
a bushel is the price!

00:47:53.717 --> 00:47:56.175
15 shillings a bushel
and not a penny less!

00:48:00.269 --> 00:48:02.070
All these years, I've
thought of none but you.

00:48:02.517 --> 00:48:04.788
I've been waiting, in the
hope that, one day...

00:48:05.342 --> 00:48:08.904
I cannot bear it, Andrew. Are
we to endure it all again?

00:48:10.321 --> 00:48:13.551
- The parting and the heartache?
- No. Not the parting.

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:16.481
I swear to you, never the parting.

00:48:19.085 --> 00:48:22.652
- We should leave. It is not safe here.
- Of course. Follow me.

00:48:29.909 --> 00:48:31.932
Damn! I know who you are!

00:48:39.975 --> 00:48:40.975
Get out of it!

00:48:41.455 --> 00:48:43.109
Get out!

00:49:25.979 --> 00:49:28.620
And I could not for the life of me
choose between the blue or grey,

00:49:28.925 --> 00:49:32.776
- so I came away with none.
- I'm sorry you had a wasted journey.

00:49:34.007 --> 00:49:35.407
Did you hear anything of the riots?

00:49:35.853 --> 00:49:37.721
With our heads full
of muslin and calico?

00:49:38.795 --> 00:49:42.640
Verity, we must try again next
week. Can you spare the time?

00:49:43.403 --> 00:49:44.403
I can.

00:49:46.033 --> 00:49:48.694
And how was the party?
Dull as you feared?

00:49:50.344 --> 00:49:51.344
Duller.

00:49:58.939 --> 00:50:01.445
I don't imagine we've seen
the last of the unrest.

00:50:03.111 --> 00:50:04.583
I wonder how Verity and I missed it.

00:50:06.056 --> 00:50:08.684
But we'd so much to talk of,
we barely noticed another soul.

00:50:10.356 --> 00:50:12.206
Verity seemed in high spirits.

00:50:12.859 --> 00:50:13.914
She did, indeed.

00:50:15.645 --> 00:50:17.933
I'm that glad. She deserves
to be content.

00:50:19.311 --> 00:50:21.181
She should make the most of it.

00:50:22.211 --> 00:50:23.211
Why?

00:50:24.658 --> 00:50:26.170
Her life is about to change...

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:29.447
and not for the better.

00:50:40.978 --> 00:50:42.601
It was monstrous crowded in Truro.

00:50:43.327 --> 00:50:45.211
Kenwyn Street was a boiling of miners

00:50:45.506 --> 00:50:48.506
- and there was talk of a riot.
- There will be rioting closer to home soon.

00:50:48.947 --> 00:50:50.374
All these years...

00:50:51.997 --> 00:50:53.832
Damn, it was old afore I was born.

00:50:55.944 --> 00:50:57.457
Old John Trenwith

00:50:58.223 --> 00:51:03.921
- cut the first goffin the year afore he died.
- 200 years ago.

00:51:05.201 --> 00:51:11.041
- And never closed. Not once.
- Not long since, it yielded thousands a year.

00:51:12.156 --> 00:51:15.582
It don't seem right. It
don't seem right, at all.

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:17.570
What's this?

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:23.857
- Shall you tell her?
- Or shall I let you have the pleasure?

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.438
For months now, you know that
Grambler has been failing.

00:51:29.824 --> 00:51:32.924
- She means, Francis has been failing!
- We could no longer afford

00:51:33.492 --> 00:51:36.822
- the repayments on the loans.
- Thanks to his profligacy and mismanagement!

00:51:37.422 --> 00:51:41.342
So, in an attempt to recoup these
losses, Francis today staked...

00:51:42.106 --> 00:51:44.825
- Gambled... - .. the mine.
- Mmm.

00:51:45.874 --> 00:51:47.234
On a game of cards.

00:51:54.982 --> 00:51:55.982
He lost.

00:52:02.982 --> 00:52:04.727
What does this mean?

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:06.489
For Francis?

00:52:08.186 --> 00:52:11.072
Loss of income, loss of pride...

00:52:13.345 --> 00:52:15.089
loss of family inheritance.

00:52:17.375 --> 00:52:20.727
For Verity and Elizabeth? A sharp
decline in their standard of living.

00:52:24.353 --> 00:52:25.353
For the Warleggans?

00:52:26.273 --> 00:52:28.459
A chance to tighten
their stranglehold,

00:52:28.919 --> 00:52:30.118
by closing down a rival mine.

00:52:32.639 --> 00:52:34.631
And for the poor souls
who worked there?

00:52:35.443 --> 00:52:36.806
Unimaginable hardship.

00:52:39.642 --> 00:52:42.715
All because one man was weak
and others were greedy.

00:52:49.056 --> 00:52:51.138
So often, I've envied Elizabeth.

00:52:55.215 --> 00:52:56.215
Why?

00:52:58.591 --> 00:53:00.063
Why did you envy Francis?

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:22.211
There's no need for you to come.

00:53:22.307 --> 00:53:23.307
Elizabeth!

00:53:23.972 --> 00:53:24.972
Elizabeth!

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:34.151
What I did was unforgiveable...

00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:38.723
but my love for you...

00:53:41.345 --> 00:53:44.480
my love will... always...

00:54:08.635 --> 00:54:09.870
My friends...

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:14.663
this has been a Poldark
mine for over 200 years.

00:54:16.602 --> 00:54:18.803
Generations of all our families
have worked it together.

00:54:21.402 --> 00:54:24.904
It was my dearest wish that
my own son take it up,

00:54:25.723 --> 00:54:31.481
but... time and... circumstance
have ruined that hope.

00:54:34.991 --> 00:54:37.059
It may be that we shall
all meet here again...

00:54:38.921 --> 00:54:40.327
to see her resurrection, but...

00:54:43.579 --> 00:54:45.483
for the... present...

00:54:47.691 --> 00:54:48.691
um...

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:54.432
It is... it is now 12 noon.

00:56:34.495 --> 00:56:35.495
Elizabeth.

00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:38.940
What can I do?

00:56:42.054 --> 00:56:44.210
Not once has Francis
asked me that question.

00:56:44.852 --> 00:56:45.852
He's afraid to.

00:56:47.066 --> 00:56:49.186
You must know this was never
what he intended for you.

00:56:50.324 --> 00:56:51.577
And yet, it is how it is.

00:56:52.673 --> 00:56:56.175
And we shall weather it.
Retrench, make economies.

00:56:57.456 --> 00:56:59.150
There are many worse off than we.

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.151
Let Francis feel sorry for himself.

00:57:05.124 --> 00:57:06.792
I will not do so.

00:57:26.333 --> 00:57:27.517
He'll need to watch his step.

00:57:31.866 --> 00:57:32.866
He's young.

00:57:33.631 --> 00:57:34.631
And handsome!

00:57:36.953 --> 00:57:37.953
And green.

00:57:39.503 --> 00:57:40.503
And free.

00:57:42.166 --> 00:57:43.166
Do you envy him?

00:57:46.989 --> 00:57:47.989
Sometimes.

00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:56.213
You were right.

00:57:57.373 --> 00:57:58.931
The world is a harder place now.

00:58:01.549 --> 00:58:02.558
The stakes are higher.

00:58:04.917 --> 00:58:05.987
Losses more painful.

00:58:09.524 --> 00:58:11.085
Yet, I would not change
places with him.

00:58:13.785 --> 00:58:15.865
My life is more precious
for being less certain

00:58:17.393 --> 00:58:18.773
and richer for being poorer.

00:58:22.439 --> 00:58:23.439
What does it mean?

00:58:25.051 --> 00:58:26.051
"Resurgam"?

00:58:28.664 --> 00:58:29.856
"I shall rise again".

00:58:32.759 --> 00:58:33.759
Shall we?

00:58:38.055 --> 00:58:39.055
I hope so.
