00:01:58.285 --> 00:01:59.958
POLDARK: I thought this
day would never come.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.417
Expectations are high.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.457
Pray God we don't
disappoint them.

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:05.092
Aye.

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:36.285
TRENEGLOS:
A pleasant change,

00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:38.371
to see a mine opening.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:41.537
For how long, I wonder?

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:56.469
My friends, when my father
closed this mine 20 years ago,

00:02:56.635 --> 00:03:01.141
he little thought
it would have a future.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:06.483
Today, with your help, labor,
and good wishes,

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.522
we aim to prove him wrong.

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:13.782
Gentlemen, ladies, I declare
the Wheal Leisure mine open.

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:19.622
(cheers and applause)

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.216
'Tis a grand thing ye done,
Ross.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:30.384
Thank you, Ross.
Zacky...

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:32.797
Mark.
Can't thank you enough.

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:34.180
Then don't.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.467
If all goes well,
it's I who'll be thanking you.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.931
Sir.

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:49.446
I'm that glad, sir.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.153
For the miners and their
families, and for you, sir!

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:53.316
My neck's on the line.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:54.405
Are you glad about that?

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:55.740
Oh, no, sir.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.745
For what shall I do
if it come to grief?

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.411
DR. CHOAKE: Are the rumors
true, do you think?

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:07.878
Well, he's a damned fool
if they're not.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.131
FRANCIS:
I take it you've forgiven him?

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:15.218
He saved your life.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.259
Time for you to demonstrate
it wasn't wasted.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.268
I have no mine to resurrect.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:21.974
You have one to keep alive.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:26.438
Start by stemming the leakage
of workers from our mine to his.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.398
Well, that's easier said
than done.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.779
Our wages are hardly
an incentive to stay.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.563
POLDARK: We will have iron
ladders down the main shaft.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.315
Iron?
Wood rots.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:10.193
It'll cost you.

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.354
Better me than a man's life.

00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:15.900
(metal clanging in the distance)

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:19.491
Two shafts have been sunk,
but it's hard going.

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:21.906
We struck ironstone
almost at once.

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:23.198
We may yet require gunpowder.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:24.457
More expense then?

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.835
Aye, but don't
be discouraged.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.872
Where there's ironstone,
there's often copper.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.882
There.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.265
Do you mark that?

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.430
Chase that and we'll hope
to catch copper.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:07.617
(coins jangle)

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.628
PRUDIE:
Don't you!

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:15.883
JUD:
Take that!

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.294
Don't you hit me again!

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.384
Judas!

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:22.970
I can hear you kicking up
a dido three mile away!

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.430
'Tis this great buffle head!

00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:26.220
Hush your creening, woman!

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.184
You think cheese
wouldn't choke you!

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.144
Be she who started it.

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:31.854
Mr. Ross's rum again?

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.769
He won't miss it.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.482
His head be fair full
of the mine.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.613
(sobbing):
He's gone and broke me arm!

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.445
(sighing):
Let's see.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:46.532
It is only a sprain,
but you'll not be fit

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.371
to cook vittles
this three week.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:51.662
You must step into
the breach, then!

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:54.627
It's all right, child,
Prudie'll instruct you.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.293
Talk of the blind
leading the blind?

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.007
Well, don't just
stand there,

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.470
brew us a dish of tea
while I rest me broken wing.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.770
(pot slams loudly)

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:14.025
(bell ringing)

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.651
Ross, have you got a minute?

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.161
By all means.

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.665
It's young Jim.

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:31.076
What's he been up to now?

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.045
My Jinny.

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:47.059
Poaching's
a capital offense.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:51.563
Believe me, I'm acquainted
with the niceties of the law.

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.065
It's not for my sake, Ross,
it's for me mother and sisters.

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:55.350
I can't see them starve.

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:56.609
And Jinny?

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:57.860
Sir?

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.442
Is her welfare
of equal concern to you?

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:04.280
Her father tells me
she's with child.

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:07.366
Yes, sir, and I mean to do right
by her when I can afford it.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.122
Damn it, man,
the girl's frantic!

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.248
Why didn't you
come to me before?

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:14.912
Why, Ross,
but could ye do?

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:22.302
It wants some small repairs.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.258
But nothing to pay?

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:27.766
You'd be doing me a favor
keeping it clean and dry.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.551
(coughs)

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.470
'Tis more than we could ever
have hoped.

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.263
Well, then,
that's settled.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.774
So now what's your excuse?

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.024
Sir?

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.651
Don't keep the girl waiting!

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.110
Be off to her father,
and while you're at it,

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:45.651
see Reverend Odgers
about getting the banns read.

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:48.536
And get rid of those nets.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:49.867
Let's have
no more poaching.

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:55.220
So Prudie's recovery
may take some time?

00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:56.638
Happen a month or so, sir.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.565
Have her delay it
<i>as</i> long as possible.

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:29.303
(band playing)

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.374
I wish you could
forget him, my dear.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.886
(voice breaking):
Is love so easy to forget?

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:15.675
Forgive me.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:20.188
I didn't mean to--
I didn't mean to suggest...

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:22.690
(gasps)

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:29.610
(groans and exhales)

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:31.240
(bell rings)

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:34.198
Mrs. Tabb,
send for Dr. Choake!

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.362
(band playing)

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.202
REVEREND ODGERS: I wonder you do not
think of marriage, Captain Poldark?

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:45.338
I dare say I shall
in due course.

00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:49.171
Always remembering the purpose
for which it was ordained?

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.211
In particular?

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:55.883
As a remedy against sin
and to avoid fornication?

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.393
MRS. ZACKY:
We can't thank you enough.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.651
Any man would do the same.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.064
"Any man" would not.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.608
The only son.

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.321
ZACKY: And since his
father bit the dust...

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:16.657
There's next to nothing coming
into the household.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:23.911
(breathing heavily)

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.500
(groans softly)

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.423
(groans)

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:42.770
(band continues playing)

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:21.177
<i>♪♪</i>

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.868
CHARLES:
A grandson!

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.918
The line continues.

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:57.007
Well done, my boy!

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.592
Thank Elizabeth.

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:00.177
She did the work.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.434
Ah, women, they make a song
and dance about it,

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:04.469
but if things are
properly managed...

00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:07.020
A new Poldark!

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.693
(Demelza singing)

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:32.088
(snoring)

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.793
(door slams)

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.836
A letter...

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:41.005
A letter come from Trenwith.

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:54.770
Francis and Elizabeth
have a son.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.799
(woman giggling)

00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:45.991
Ah, Ross.

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:50.250
We were just saying, any man
opening a mine these days

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:52.957
must be exceptionally brave
or extremely foolish.

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:55.121
How so?

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:57.916
Well, in these dire
economic times.

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:00.505
Which might be less dire
were they not in the hands

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:03.262
of those whose only purpose
is to make a profit.

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:04.889
What other purpose
is there?

00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:08.472
Perhaps you should ask those
who exist on starvation wages.

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:11.513
Perhaps if you fraternized less
with the lower orders

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:13.681
you'd feel their woes
less keenly.

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:16.317
One does feel that
the gentry and the vulgars

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.274
should keep to themselves.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:19.938
Otherwise it gets so confusing.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:24.867
Good day.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.657
AUNT AGATHA:
Have we been introduced?

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.621
I seem to recall
you're related to me.

00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:35.206
Forgive me, Aunt.

00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:36.871
I've had much
to attend to of late.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.540
How are you?

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:42.210
How should I be with
Mistress Glumps for company?

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:45.801
CHARLES: Verity is well rid
of that Scoundrel, Blarney.

00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:49.388
I trust you've learnt
the folly of interference?

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.850
It won't be repeated,
I assure you, Uncle.

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.889
What do you make
of my grandson?

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.732
Please...

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.166
A fine-looking boy,
is he not?

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:14.576
Like his father.

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:16.494
And his mother?

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.663
I congratulate you both.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.672
Please.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.008
Ah, George.

00:17:28.589 --> 00:17:29.841
You look pale.

00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:33.261
I've been stronger.

00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:36.476
I'd hoped you would be
named godfather.

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.641
But Francis and George
are inseparable these days.

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:45.152
Look at Geoffrey Charles.

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.071
He's smiling at you!

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.706
ROSS:
I can't imagine why.

00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:00.296
(indistinct chatter)

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:09.930
Elizabeth?

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:21.976
(glass clinking)

00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:25.070
CHARLES:
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:28.984
This is a proud day
for the Poldarks.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:34.452
Behold the future:
Geoffrey Charles Poldark,

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:37.868
heir to the great
Trenwith estate.

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:42.540
And when I have taken leave
of this world,

00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:48.257
and Francis has taught the boy
all he knows...

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:50.012
(quietly):
That shouldn't take long.

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:54.642
CHARLES:
Our great Poldark dynasty...

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.519
will continue and...

00:18:57.678 --> 00:18:59.351
(groans)

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:01.311
This wind-- damn me!

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:02.726
Dr. Choake, quickly.

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:06.278
Father...

00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:07.734
Carry him through,
come on.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.828
On a christening day?

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.119
And the child named after him?

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:22.582
'Tis a sign.

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:23.997
Mark my words.

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:01.083
Of course a gentleman knows
where to draw the line.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:03.370
Towards a lady of his own class,
his intention should be

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:05.038
strictly honorable.

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.421
Towards a woman

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.127
of the lower class,
however...

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.588
Indeed, it's all very
disagreeable, but men are men.

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:12.298
When Peter called
some months ago,

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:15.305
there was the hussy already
beginning to put on airs.

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:17.137
I saw her riding to church,
bold as brass,

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:19.051
all fit up in a scarlet cloak.

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:21.437
MRS. WARLEGGAN: It's too bad,
tarnishes the family name,

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:24.269
and my Elizabeth
would undoubtedly...

00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:30.438
Proof, if proof
were needed.

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:33.357
That Ross Poldark
is no gentleman.

00:20:33.524 --> 00:20:34.992
Hyah!

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:47.462
Good night,
my darling boy.

00:20:53.002 --> 00:20:55.096
(door opens)

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:58.884
My poor wife,
neglected as usual.

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:00.175
How is your father?

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.889
Rallying-

00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:04.305
Despite Choake's efforts.

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:08.067
You look very lovely,
my dear.

00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:25.664
Perhaps another night?

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.578
I still feel a little weak.

00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:31.466
You seemed most animated
this afternoon.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:36.095
With Ross.

00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:37.596
That's hardly fair.

00:21:37.755 --> 00:21:38.927
"Oh, Ross, look at my baby.

00:21:39.089 --> 00:21:40.682
"See how he smiles at you.

00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:42.343
Don't you wish
that he was yours?"

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.682
How can you say that?!

00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:50.318
Of course, Ross would never
even think such a thing.

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:52.570
No, I'm sure
he would not!

00:21:54.396 --> 00:21:55.739
(door slams)
(baby cries)

00:21:55.898 --> 00:21:58.401
Listening at keyholes?

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:00.114
I've been tending to Father.

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:01.529
No doubt you'll take
Elizabeth's side.

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:03.697
Against whom?
Or Ross's!

00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:05.866
I take no one's side!

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:07.785
Had it been left to him,
you would be in Falmouth now

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:11.877
living with that scoundrel
in shame and misery!

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:13.791
I don't regard marriage
as misery.

00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:17.212
That's because you have yet
to experience it.

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:22.599
(quietly):
For which I have you to thank.

00:22:34.812 --> 00:22:36.064
((109 barks)

00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:39.949
(whispering):
Jim.

00:22:57.167 --> 00:23:00.922
(loud thrashing)

00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:17.400
<i>JINNY:
Jim's a good man,</i>

00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:19.486
and it is good he should

00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:22.743
want to provide for his family,
but not with poaching.

00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:24.575
It's too dangerous.

00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:27.832
Could you maybe ask Captain Ross
to tell him to stop?

00:23:31.994 --> 00:23:35.589
DEMELZA: Mr. Ross, can
I speak to thee, sir?

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:38.671
Mr. Ross, sir?

00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:41.720
(snoring)

00:23:41.879 --> 00:23:43.301
Sir?

00:23:49.553 --> 00:23:51.100
Mr. Ross?

00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:17.173
"We-heal"... Wheal.

00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:22.053
"Leh-i-sir."

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:54.622
<i>♪♪</i>

00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:09.140
ROSS:
Demelza?

00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:15.230
Captain Poldark, sir?

00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:16.766
Do you need me?

00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:21.479
FRANCIS:
A heart stroke?

00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:22.988
But Choake says you'll recover?

00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:24.615
Choake's a fool.

00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:26.116
And I am not immortal.

00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:29.154
So this is your chance.

00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:31.663
To do what?

00:25:31.822 --> 00:25:34.120
Step up to the mark.

00:25:34.283 --> 00:25:37.583
You do recall
we have a mine?

00:25:37.745 --> 00:25:40.248
Yes, but...

00:25:40.414 --> 00:25:42.166
It requires presence.

00:25:42.332 --> 00:25:43.834
Direction.

00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:45.093
Leadership.

00:25:45.252 --> 00:25:46.549
Yours.

00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:50.306
(loudly):
Yours!

00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:51.809
L-I know little of...

00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:53.059
Learn.

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:54.390
Fast.

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:57.397
If your cousin continues
to pay decent wages,

00:25:57.556 --> 00:26:00.105
we'll soon have no one left
at Grambler.

00:26:07.858 --> 00:26:09.952
Take a leaf out of
your cousin's book.

00:26:12.446 --> 00:26:14.244
<i>Does he keep his distance?</i>

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:19.082
<i>Does he watch from afar?</i>

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:23.294
<i>Or does he roll up his sleeves
and toil alongside his men?</i>

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.173
Good day to you all.

00:26:28.879 --> 00:26:32.304
<i>CHARLES". Which do you think
will yield the better result?</i>

00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:52.237
How much longer do you think
before we eat'?

00:26:57.991 --> 00:26:59.959
And perhaps if there's
some bread.

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:04.581
And maybe some...

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.302
...Ale.

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:11.555
Have you eaten?

00:27:11.713 --> 00:27:15.593
I do sometimes forget to, sir.

00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:17.136
Eat now.

00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:18.474
Sit.

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:34.615
You finished
the lower field?

00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:36.826
Yes, sir, and tomorrow
I be starting

00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:38.206
on the meadow.

00:27:38.365 --> 00:27:39.992
You get through more in a day
than Prudie in a month!

00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:44.171
I be young, sir, and strong.

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:45.876
And not bone idle.

00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:57.225
I heard Jinny was over.

00:27:57.384 --> 00:27:58.977
How is she?

00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:03.019
In truth, sir?

00:28:05.475 --> 00:28:06.692
She's that worried.

00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:08.320
About what?

00:28:08.478 --> 00:28:10.856
Jim and his poaching.

00:28:11.023 --> 00:28:14.573
I thought perhaps you could
tell him to stop.

00:28:16.778 --> 00:28:19.156
I'll do more than that.

00:28:19.323 --> 00:28:20.415
I've a better job for him.

00:28:20.574 --> 00:28:25.171
Assistant purser
at the mine.

00:28:25.329 --> 00:28:27.673
Oh, Jinny'll be that glad!

00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:54.783
Why must you go?

00:28:54.942 --> 00:28:57.195
We don't need nothing more.

00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:59.580
Captain Poldark did give you
work, and this cottage, and...

00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:03.413
It's not just for we, Jinny.

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:06.704
Captain Poldark do help us,
but I can't ask him to help

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.589
my mother and sisters.

00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:11.921
And since father be gone,
who else can put bread

00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:14.428
in their mouths but I?

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.930
She'd not wish you
to take such risk.

00:29:20.926 --> 00:29:23.554
There will be no more
after tonight.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.064
You have me word.

00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:31.820
I won't be long.

00:29:32.896 --> 00:29:33.988
(door opens)

00:29:34.147 --> 00:29:35.399
You know I love you.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.157
Demelza, do we have
any of that...

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.412
Brandy, sir?

00:29:41.571 --> 00:29:45.166
Last of that hid in
the cupboard from France?

00:29:45.325 --> 00:29:46.622
Exactly so.

00:29:48.954 --> 00:29:51.048
Anything else?

00:29:51.206 --> 00:29:52.708
Yes, if you could somehow
avoid the inference

00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:54.421
that I'm utterly predictable?

00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:56.211
Yes, sir.

00:29:56.378 --> 00:29:58.472
I'll try, sir.

00:30:11.018 --> 00:30:13.362
(birds chirping)

00:30:31.204 --> 00:30:34.504
(coughing)

00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:49.064
(footsteps approaching)

00:30:50.307 --> 00:30:51.399
C)y!

00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:54.735
(gunshot)

00:31:10.077 --> 00:31:12.296
(knock at door)

00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:22.506
(sobbing)

00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:27.306
POLDARK:
I shouldn't have waited.

00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:29.813
I should have made him
the offer last night!

00:31:31.473 --> 00:31:32.895
What will you do?

00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:35.106
Visit Sir Hugh Bodrugan,
the owner of the pheasants.

00:31:40.941 --> 00:31:42.067
Ross Poldark!

00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:44.111
Are you joining
the hunt, sir?

00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:45.529
Thank you, no.

00:31:45.695 --> 00:31:47.789
But I would be grateful
for five minutes of your time.

00:31:47.948 --> 00:31:49.541
What can I do for you?

00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:51.201
The poacher taken last night
on your land?

00:31:51.368 --> 00:31:52.836
As magistrate, you'll have
hearing of the case?

00:31:52.994 --> 00:31:54.211
He's an employee
of mine.

00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:55.668
Is he, by God!

00:31:55.831 --> 00:31:58.254
I would happily make good
anyl oss

00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:00.385
if he could be let off
with a severe warning.

00:32:00.544 --> 00:32:02.888
(chuckling): Blast me, sir,
he's on his way to Truro jail!

00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:05.469
I had him committed for trial
at 8:00 this morning.

00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:07.305
You were in haste, sir.

00:32:07.467 --> 00:32:09.435
There was no time to lose--
the hunt starts at 9:00!

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:11.312
It's a damned disgrace
the amount of good game

00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:12.597
going lost of late.

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.732
Hangings barely good enough
for the villain!

00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:18.820
(hunting horn blares
in the distance)

00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:26.828
ROSS: They disgust
me, my own class.

00:32:26.987 --> 00:32:31.993
Not all of them, but most.

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:35.038
How is it, sir, that you be
not like them?

00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:36.500
Perhaps I am.

00:32:36.663 --> 00:32:39.587
No, no, sir, they don't
see us like you do.

00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:44.380
There's folk with hurts
and feelings, same as they.

00:32:44.546 --> 00:32:48.596
Sometimes I fail to see
that too, Demelza.

00:32:48.758 --> 00:32:54.265
Sometimes I barely see
what's right in front of me.

00:32:59.436 --> 00:33:01.313
He's just a lad, sir.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.948
They must sure let him go.

00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:05.450
You would think so.

00:33:11.114 --> 00:33:12.457
Is Jinny ready?

00:33:12.616 --> 00:33:14.414
She can't go, Ross.

00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:15.418
<i>"Us her time.</i>

00:33:15.577 --> 00:33:16.544
(Jinny groaning)

00:33:18.288 --> 00:33:20.256
Bring him safe home, Ross.

00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:22.213
(Jinny groaning)

00:33:42.604 --> 00:33:44.231
<i>DR. HALSE:
It was being unemployed by you</i>

00:33:44.397 --> 00:33:46.274
in soliciting that pardon

00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:51.698
from the Almighty which I trust
your prayers may obtain

00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:54.457
through the merits
of your Redeemer,

00:33:54.616 --> 00:33:59.213
whose first attribute is mercy.

00:33:59.371 --> 00:34:04.423
It now only remains to me
to <i>pass</i> the dreadful sentence

00:34:04.584 --> 00:34:06.507
of the law, which is

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:07.546
to transportation.

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:09.180
Take him away.

00:34:09.339 --> 00:34:12.013
(crowd shouts and boos)

00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:14.970
(bangs gavel)

00:34:15.136 --> 00:34:16.604
(whispering):
What was his crime?

00:34:16.763 --> 00:34:18.140
Poaching.

00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:22.602
<i>Award, sh"?</i>

00:34:22.769 --> 00:34:25.943
Oh... don't tell me.

00:34:26.106 --> 00:34:27.323
More funds required?

00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:29.029
No, another matter entirely.

00:34:29.192 --> 00:34:32.571
You treated Jim Carter when
he worked at Wheal Reath?

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:33.863
Convulsive asthma,

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.249
a morbid condition
of the lungs.

00:34:36.408 --> 00:34:39.503
Did for his father,
as I recall.

00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:41.709
Why do you ask?

00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:43.714
Only with evidence
of ill health

00:34:43.873 --> 00:34:45.420
and testament
of good character,

00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:47.382
I'd hope we could get
the charge dismissed.

00:34:47.544 --> 00:34:49.672
<i>Dismissed'?</i>

00:34:49.838 --> 00:34:52.808
I doubt his lungs would
survive a stint in jail.

00:34:52.966 --> 00:34:56.140
To be frank with you, sir, I've
no great sympathy for your aims.

00:34:56.303 --> 00:34:59.102
No good will come of being
sentimental about such folk.

00:34:59.264 --> 00:35:01.358
They're a different
breed, sir.

00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:02.608
A different breed.

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:04.519
MAN:
Call James Carter.

00:35:04.686 --> 00:35:07.030
(door opens)

00:35:41.056 --> 00:35:43.525
Will you join me?

00:35:43.683 --> 00:35:44.980
I have an estate to run.

00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.360
One game won't hurt.

00:36:00.283 --> 00:36:02.706
So he was caught red-handed?

00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:05.463
And according to Sir Hugh,
there's scarcely a pheasant

00:36:05.622 --> 00:36:06.919
left in his woods?

00:36:07.082 --> 00:36:09.084
You may stand down.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.002
Is there any defense
in this case?

00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:13.592
May I ask the indulgence
of the court?

00:36:13.755 --> 00:36:17.601
You have some evidence you wish
to give in this man's defense?

00:36:17.759 --> 00:36:19.682
I wish to give evidence
of his good character.

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.437
He's my servant.

00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:23.815
Take the witness stand, sir.

00:36:23.973 --> 00:36:28.399
(crowd murmuring)

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.576
(bangs gavel)

00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:39.990
No doubt, on the evidence
you've heard,

00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:42.033
you will see nothing
exceptional in this case.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.249
In your long experience I'm sure
there are many such cases

00:36:45.412 --> 00:36:47.665
especially in times

00:36:47.831 --> 00:36:51.631
when hunger, poverty,
and sickness

00:36:51.793 --> 00:36:53.795
prevail amongst the poor.

00:36:53.962 --> 00:36:55.509
Keep to the matter
in hand, sir.

00:36:55.672 --> 00:36:59.893
I've reason to believe that the
accused fell into bad company

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:03.521
with an older man who has
so far escaped punishment.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:09.858
He has a wife, a mother,
and four sisters to support.

00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:11.271
Evidence, sir?

00:37:11.438 --> 00:37:12.860
Pertaining to the crime itself?

00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:15.366
I have it on the authority
of Dr. Choake of Sawle

00:37:15.525 --> 00:37:17.698
that Jim Carter is suffering

00:37:17.861 --> 00:37:19.909
from a chronic lung condition
which may prove fatal.

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.540
I myself am prepared
to stand surety

00:37:22.699 --> 00:37:24.701
for his future employ
and good behavior.

00:37:24.868 --> 00:37:27.587
Is it your contention, sir,
that the prisoner is not

00:37:27.746 --> 00:37:29.919
in a fit state of health
to go to prison?

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:32.049
It is, sir.

00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:35.337
And furthermore, this very day
he will become a father

00:37:35.503 --> 00:37:36.675
for the first time.

00:37:36.838 --> 00:37:39.091
(crowd murmuring)

00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:40.349
(bangs gavel)

00:37:42.385 --> 00:37:44.183
The prisoner was ill
when he went poaching?

00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:46.188
He's been ill for some time.

00:37:46.347 --> 00:37:48.975
And his wife has been
with child "for some time"?

00:37:49.142 --> 00:37:53.318
It appears to me that if a man
is well enough to go poaching

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.198
he's well enough to take
the consequences

00:37:55.356 --> 00:38:00.203
whether or not it adversely
affects his wife and child.

00:38:06.201 --> 00:38:11.503
PRUDIE: And when you get home there
be calves to be meated and...

00:38:11.664 --> 00:38:12.756
Who be this here, then?

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:16.469
PRUDIE:
That be the maid's father.

00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:18.096
DEMELZA:
What can he be wanting?

00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:32.812
So... you be here still.

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:35.821
And content too, Father.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.324
And I hope you are too.

00:38:40.819 --> 00:38:42.947
Take a look at me, daughter.

00:38:45.865 --> 00:38:47.458
What do you see?

00:38:47.617 --> 00:38:49.915
What's happened?

00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:52.297
I be married.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:55.542
The Widow Chegwidden

00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:57.802
have raised me up and brought me
out to meet the Lord.

00:38:57.961 --> 00:38:59.713
Meaning what?

00:38:59.879 --> 00:39:00.675
Meaning farewell drink

00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:02.807
and living in sin.

00:39:02.966 --> 00:39:07.437
We live a good life now,
daughter.

00:39:07.595 --> 00:39:09.768
And we be fixing
to have you back.

00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:13.484
'Tis a fine woman
I've married, child.

00:39:13.643 --> 00:39:18.114
And they do think you be better
with me than staying here

00:39:18.273 --> 00:39:22.153
exposed to all temptations...
of flesh and the devil.

00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:23.410
Temptations?

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.914
You don't know of what I speak.

00:39:27.574 --> 00:39:30.248
Confess, daughter,
what sin there is

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:31.502
twixt you and Poldark.

00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:33.083
There's no sin!

00:39:33.246 --> 00:39:35.465
He's my master,
and I'm his servant.

00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:37.546
And more besides,
if tales be true.

00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:38.881
What's it to me what folks say?

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:40.545
Not to thee maybe,

00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:43.181
but I want no daughter of mine
mixed up in such talk.

00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:45.057
Since when were you
so tender to me?

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:47.969
Since the Lord opened my heart
and shone his light.

00:39:49.554 --> 00:39:52.023
So I give you a day
to make it right with Poldark,

00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:55.731
and then I'll be back here again
to fetch you home.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.124
(sobs)

00:40:21.628 --> 00:40:22.880
You paint a vivid picture

00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:25.674
of the hardships endured
by the poor, sir.

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:31.517
Still, a man's needs should
not determine his honesty,

00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:33.932
else all beggars would be
thieves.

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:35.190
(crowd murmuring)

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.193
(bangs gavel)

00:40:37.352 --> 00:40:40.982
However, in view of these
extenuating circumstances

00:40:41.147 --> 00:40:44.447
and your testimony
of Carter's good character,

00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:48.239
the court is prepared to take
a more lenient view.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.799
Sentenced to two years
imprisonment.

00:40:59.958 --> 00:41:01.255
(crowd murmurs)

00:41:05.254 --> 00:41:08.599
(coughs)

00:41:08.758 --> 00:41:10.806
Well, I trust I shall never
have the misfortune

00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:12.721
to have the "leniency"
of the court extended to me!

00:41:12.887 --> 00:41:14.514
Have a care, Mr. Poldark.

00:41:14.681 --> 00:41:16.274
Such remarks are not entirely

00:41:16.432 --> 00:41:18.230
outside the court's
jurisdiction.

00:41:18.393 --> 00:41:19.485
No.

00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:22.488
Only mercy enjoys
that privilege.

00:41:23.398 --> 00:41:25.071
One moment, sir.

00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:28.533
You take issue
with the laws of this land?

00:41:28.695 --> 00:41:30.618
I can't help but feel
that in this case

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.909
justice would have been
best served by clemency.

00:41:34.075 --> 00:41:35.418
Happily for justice,

00:41:35.576 --> 00:41:39.831
this court is better able
to interpret the law than you.

00:41:39.998 --> 00:41:44.128
Then the law is savage and you
interpret it without charity!

00:41:44.293 --> 00:41:46.136
The book from which you preach

00:41:46.295 --> 00:41:48.218
<i>says</i> that man shall not live
by bread alone!

00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:50.884
These days you're asking him
to live without even that!

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.597
Step down, Mr. Poldark,

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.263
or we'll have you committed
for contempt of court.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.148
I can assure you,
such a committal would be

00:41:57.306 --> 00:42:00.526
an entirely accurate reading
of my thoughts!

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.152
(door opens and closes)

00:42:10.653 --> 00:42:12.075
<i>DEMELZA:
How can I go'?</i>

00:42:12.238 --> 00:42:14.616
I can't live nowhere else.

00:42:14.782 --> 00:42:16.830
'Till I came
I never lived at all.

00:42:16.993 --> 00:42:19.337
I can't leave here.

00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:24.755
(quietly):
I can't leave him.

00:42:24.917 --> 00:42:27.045
(sighs)

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:28.713
He'll make me go.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.679
He won't care.

00:42:31.841 --> 00:42:34.435
I'm not so important
to him as he is to me.

00:42:34.594 --> 00:42:36.642
Spare yourself
the trouble, child.

00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:39.057
He'll not be home tonight.

00:42:51.903 --> 00:42:55.282
What cheer,
Captain Poldark?

00:42:55.448 --> 00:42:57.496
Precious little.

00:42:57.658 --> 00:42:59.410
I could remedy that.

00:42:59.577 --> 00:43:00.703
You could not.

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:05.337
(sniffles)
Nobody could.

00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:10.672
Then I shall take my consolation
where it's more appreciated.

00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:25.858
(men laughing)

00:43:27.522 --> 00:43:28.774
A Poldark you say?

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.193
Not a Poldark.

00:43:31.359 --> 00:43:32.485
(gasps)

00:43:32.652 --> 00:43:35.531
(giggles)
The Poldark.

00:43:35.696 --> 00:43:37.664
Of Trenwith House.

00:43:37.824 --> 00:43:38.916
Lord bless you, sir.

00:43:39.075 --> 00:43:42.079
What other Poldark is there?

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:10.865
(man shouting, rats squeaking)

00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:15.244
MAN:
Let me out!

00:44:20.032 --> 00:44:22.126
'Twas more than good
of you to try, Ross.

00:44:22.285 --> 00:44:23.377
Don't thank me.

00:44:23.536 --> 00:44:25.413
I failed miserably.

00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:31.506
(man groaning)

00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:33.137
(softly):
Jinny...

00:44:42.221 --> 00:44:44.565
(sighs)

00:44:50.605 --> 00:44:51.857
Goodbye.

00:44:56.319 --> 00:45:00.449
Goodbye, goodbye... goodbye.

00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:05.582
(sobbing): I can't leave
him, I can't, I can't...

00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:09.044
But I must.

00:45:09.207 --> 00:45:10.299
ROSS:
Demelza!

00:45:16.797 --> 00:45:18.265
(louder):
Demelza!

00:45:41.656 --> 00:45:42.782
Demelza.

00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:44.041
Sir?

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.543
Close the window.

00:45:45.701 --> 00:45:47.078
Yes, sir.

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.553
(window closes)

00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:57.679
Jud and Prudie a-bed?

00:45:57.838 --> 00:45:59.932
Yes, sir, long since.

00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:01.183
Fetch me the rum.

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:04.561
Yes, sir.

00:46:16.899 --> 00:46:19.243
Jim Carter got two years.

00:46:21.362 --> 00:46:23.239
I feared it might be worse.

00:46:23.406 --> 00:46:26.159
I doubt he'll survive.

00:46:26.325 --> 00:46:27.872
You did all you could.

00:46:28.035 --> 00:46:29.127
Did I?

00:46:29.287 --> 00:46:31.381
I doubt it.

00:46:31.539 --> 00:46:35.214
I was too concerned
with my own dignity.

00:46:35.376 --> 00:46:39.381
Groveling and compliments
were the order of the day,

00:46:39.547 --> 00:46:43.222
and I made the mistake of trying
to teach them their business.

00:46:43.384 --> 00:46:49.517
A schoolboy error,
and Jim paid dearly for it.

00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:57.064
Demelza?

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:01.777
What are you wearing?

00:47:05.031 --> 00:47:08.956
I found it, sir, in one of
the chests in the library.

00:47:09.118 --> 00:47:10.916
You dare to go rifling
through those things?

00:47:13.039 --> 00:47:15.133
I'm sorry, sir, you never
told me I shouldn't look.

00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:16.383
Surely that was obvious?

00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:19.261
You're employed <i>as</i> a maid.

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.093
I know, sir.
And you've been a good one.

00:47:21.255 --> 00:47:23.474
And for that you're allowed
certain liberties.

00:47:23.632 --> 00:47:26.055
But dressing up in fine clothes
is not one of them.

00:47:26.218 --> 00:47:27.845
I meant no harm, sir, 'twas just
rotting away in that old box.

00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:28.729
Take it off.

00:47:28.888 --> 00:47:30.640
I thought maybe you might
let me wear it sometimes.

00:47:30.806 --> 00:47:31.978
Take it off now!

00:47:35.102 --> 00:47:36.854
If you don't take it off
this minute,

00:47:37.021 --> 00:47:39.240
you can pack your things
and go back to your father.

00:47:44.278 --> 00:47:45.404
(sobs)

00:47:45.571 --> 00:47:47.665
Demelza, enough,
enough now.

00:47:47.823 --> 00:47:49.621
I shouldn't have spoken
so harshly.

00:47:49.784 --> 00:47:51.582
(sobs)

00:47:51.744 --> 00:47:53.792
Don't take it
to heart.

00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:59.427
It's been a hellish day
and I'm not myself.

00:48:21.107 --> 00:48:22.654
What is it? What've I done?

00:48:22.817 --> 00:48:24.490
I didn't take you from
your father for this.

00:48:24.652 --> 00:48:26.370
What do it matter
what you took me for?

00:48:26.529 --> 00:48:28.372
Go to bed.
Sir...

00:48:28.531 --> 00:48:30.329
Go to bed-- now.

00:49:15.077 --> 00:49:17.626
(knock at door)

00:49:24.086 --> 00:49:25.633
What is it?

00:49:39.768 --> 00:49:43.398
(softly):
The dress.

00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:45.612
It unfastens down the back.

00:50:29.485 --> 00:50:32.580
(softly): You know
what people say of us?

00:50:32.738 --> 00:50:35.082
(softly):
Yes.

00:50:37.117 --> 00:50:42.089
If we behave like this,
it will be true.

00:50:46.043 --> 00:50:47.716
Then let it be true.

00:51:22.413 --> 00:51:25.542
(birds chirping)

00:51:57.698 --> 00:51:59.325
<i>♪♪</i>

00:52:34.193 --> 00:52:36.696
(harp playing)

00:52:36.862 --> 00:52:37.954
Where's Francis?

00:52:40.407 --> 00:52:43.081
He did not come home last night.

00:52:43.243 --> 00:52:44.995
VERITY: He'll have stayed
in town with George.

00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:46.880
That upstart?

00:52:47.039 --> 00:52:48.962
Has he been going to the mine?

00:52:49.124 --> 00:52:51.218
I'm sure he has.

00:52:51.377 --> 00:52:52.503
CHARLES:
Elizabeth?

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:55.640
Is he attending to his duties?

00:52:55.798 --> 00:52:58.221
Of course he is, sir.

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.272
Where's Demelza?

00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:06.024
Haven't seen her.

00:53:06.183 --> 00:53:07.981
When she appears, tell her
to start in the barley field.

00:53:08.143 --> 00:53:10.066
You and I will set to
with the hay.

00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:11.196
Aye, sir.

00:53:11.355 --> 00:53:12.197
L, sir?

00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:14.575
You, sir.

00:53:14.733 --> 00:53:17.077
Without Jim to cover
your idleness,

00:53:17.236 --> 00:53:19.830
you may be forced
to break a sweat occasionally.

00:53:25.703 --> 00:53:26.795
(door closes)

00:53:26.954 --> 00:53:28.046
'Tisn't right.

00:53:31.333 --> 00:53:35.713
(thrashing)

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.269
JUD: They be saying Jim Carter
won't last five minutes

00:53:46.432 --> 00:53:49.561
in Bodmin Jail.

00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:53.777
If the fever don't get him,
starvation will.

00:53:53.939 --> 00:53:57.239
Still, if someone we know
hadn't spoke up for him,

00:53:57.401 --> 00:54:01.156
he'd be on his way
to seven years transportation.

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:44.703
(door opens)

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.543
An unexpected pleasure.

00:54:55.709 --> 00:54:57.677
I was passing this way and...

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.058
I was sorry to hear
about your farm boy.

00:55:05.928 --> 00:55:09.148
Reverend Halse plays cards
with the Warleggans.

00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:10.899
And?

00:55:11.058 --> 00:55:12.731
Perhaps if you'd
approached George

00:55:12.893 --> 00:55:13.815
things could
have been arranged?

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:16.275
Is that how justice works?

00:55:16.438 --> 00:55:18.782
We both know it, Ross.

00:55:22.236 --> 00:55:24.489
How's Geoffrey Charles?

00:55:24.655 --> 00:55:26.498
He's my joy.

00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:27.783
Our joy.

00:55:29.201 --> 00:55:32.045
I heard blasting
as I came by Wheal Leisure.

00:55:32.204 --> 00:55:33.797
Have you hit ironstone?

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:37.088
This is a new interest?

00:55:37.251 --> 00:55:41.802
Francis thinks it's unladylike,
but how else can I understand

00:55:41.964 --> 00:55:43.966
the business
on which our fortunes,

00:55:44.132 --> 00:55:45.429
and those of our tenants,
depend.

00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:48.436
You always had
an inquiring mind.

00:55:48.595 --> 00:55:50.814
Marriage discourages
such a thing.

00:55:50.973 --> 00:55:52.566
Always?

00:55:52.724 --> 00:55:55.603
Perhaps it depends
on the partners.

00:55:56.937 --> 00:55:58.314
(door opens)

00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:07.789
Beg your pardon, sir, ma'am.

00:56:11.994 --> 00:56:13.120
Can I get you anything, ma'am?

00:56:13.287 --> 00:56:14.709
Prudie's served us.

00:56:14.872 --> 00:56:16.374
Her arm seems recovered.

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:17.632
Yes, sir.

00:56:22.963 --> 00:56:24.590
I'll just see to these flowers.

00:56:25.757 --> 00:56:27.805
They're very pretty.

00:56:30.137 --> 00:56:31.229
Would you like them?

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:33.982
Oh!

00:56:34.141 --> 00:56:35.893
Thank you.

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:37.481
But I'm afraid they won't last.

00:56:37.644 --> 00:56:40.568
See, they're fading
already.

00:56:41.773 --> 00:56:42.865
Cornflowers are like that.

00:56:56.455 --> 00:56:57.547
I must go.

00:56:59.333 --> 00:57:00.755
I'll see you out.

00:57:27.527 --> 00:57:29.120
(barks)

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.724
(metal scraping)

00:58:04.022 --> 00:58:05.649
Demelza?

00:58:10.237 --> 00:58:12.490
Where's Demelza?

00:58:12.656 --> 00:58:14.658
Last I seen her she were
heading towards Sawle

00:58:14.825 --> 00:58:16.702
with that blathering dog
at her heels.

00:58:26.586 --> 00:58:29.214
ROSS: I engaged you
for two years.

00:58:29.381 --> 00:58:31.725
What do you mean
by running away?

00:58:31.883 --> 00:58:33.476
Sir, I...

00:58:33.635 --> 00:58:34.887
Haven't you been well treated?

00:58:35.053 --> 00:58:36.350
Aren't you grown used
to the house,

00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:38.390
and your tasks,

00:58:38.557 --> 00:58:39.558
and my moods?

00:58:39.725 --> 00:58:40.942
Yes sir, but...

00:58:41.101 --> 00:58:42.853
Do you not give me what I want
before I even ask?

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.399
Yes, sir, but I thought,
after what happened.

00:58:46.565 --> 00:58:49.193
You thought you would no longer
be my servant.

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:52.203
Not from choice, sir.

00:58:55.782 --> 00:58:57.329
You're right.

00:58:57.492 --> 00:58:59.244
You can no longer be my servant.

00:59:03.749 --> 00:59:06.969
<i>REVEREND ODGERS". Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together here</i>

00:59:07.127 --> 00:59:10.301
in the sight of God,
to join together

00:59:10.464 --> 00:59:14.810
this man and this woman
in holy matrimony...

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:18.639
Ross Vennor Poldark,

00:59:18.805 --> 00:59:21.433
do you take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife?
