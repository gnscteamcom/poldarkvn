Why?

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.129
There are rumors
she's meeting him again.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.788
Is she?

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:12.545
I wouldn't like to say she is.

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:16.666
And I wouldn't like to say
she isn't.

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:22.639
In other words, you wouldn't
like to say anything at all.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.765
Well...

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.347
Ross, what's given in confidence
isn't fair to repeat.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.152
I can't pretend
I'm not disturbed.

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:41.608
(sighs)

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.822
I wonder how she met him again.

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.622
<i>♪♪</i>

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.235
Practice your steps.

00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:19.270
I claim first dance at the ball.

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:33.159
(hammers clanking on metal)

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.608
<i>"Us as we feared, Ross."</i>

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.109
Fever's rife at Bodmin.

00:16:58.267 --> 00:16:59.393
They're dropping like flies.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.028
Whole mine's talking of it.

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.655
Say nothing to Jinny.

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.430
(knocking on door)

00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:47.779
You're close to Jim?

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:50.946
I have known him
since he were a boy.

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:54.457
Were he my worst enemy, I'd not
wish jail pestilence on him.

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.002
(knocking)

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.210
(knocking)

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.718
(knocking)

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:21.192
Your arm is mending?

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.853
I came to see what
Dr. Enys could prescribe.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.523
He's away with my husband
till tomorrow.

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:30.321
Mrs. Daniel...?

00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:32.282
A word?

00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:42.581
Hope do love a gossip.

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:44.715
And 'tis not wise
to give them cause.

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:46.421
What cause?

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.133
<i>"Us said you have a roving eye."</i>

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:52.014
And whose business is it
where my eye do light?

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:54.050
Well, some say
it might be their business,

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:55.843
should it light
on their husbands.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.184
There's not a man in 50 miles
I'd look twice at.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:00.348
Excepting one.

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:02.141
Mark?

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:08.447
Pardon my interference.

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:09.903
'Twas kindly meant.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:31.846
You have a plan?

00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:35.300
None whatsoever.

00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:44.184
(knocking)

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.736
(Pounding)

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.946
Good evening to you, sir.

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:59.116
Dr. Enys is here to attend
on James Carter.

00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:01.124
Eh?

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:02.500
What's that?

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.288
James Carter, the typhus.

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:07.798
Be so good <i>as</i> to let us in
so we may show you our papers.

00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:15.798
There's not a moment
to lose, sir.

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.854
ROSS: This way, if you please, Dr.
Enys.

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.609
Much obliged to you.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:34.192
JAILER: Now look, they say
there be fever down 'ere.

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:35.598
We'd be sick ourselves if we...

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:37.032
ROSS: Is this the cell?

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:39.492
DWIGHT: What an affront
to human dignity.

00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:41.248
Is Jim Carter among you?

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.704
Where's your authority?

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:47.911
You must show your papers.

00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:49.085
Jim?

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.340
Jim, can you hear me?

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:51.842
DWIGHT:
Perhaps he has been moved?

00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:53.127
Are you there, Jim?

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:57.806
(rats squeaking, man moaning)

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:01.014
DWIGHT:
Dear God, look at his arm.

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:03.430
Open this cell. Eh'?

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:06.315
ROSS: This man needs
urgent medical attention.

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:07.566
We're taking him away.

00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:09.068
Nay, he be serving his sentence.

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:10.866
Open this cell before
I have you dismissed

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.442
for neglecting your duty.

00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:15.612
Give me the keys.

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:16.975
JAILER: You can't go in there.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.986
It ain't safe. There's fever!

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:26.160
I could make over the bodice,

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.624
maybe add a little lace.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:30.381
Just as you please.

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:32.667
So long as Francis thinks
it's new.

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:36.883
I'm sorry...

00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:39.765
that he's been a disappointment.

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:43.599
You... speak to me
of disappointment?

00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:50.519
Perhaps it's always the way.

00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:53.278
In the first flush of love,
we think anything is possible.

00:21:55.105 --> 00:21:57.699
We must both learn to lower
our expectations.

00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:22.467
(groaning and wheezing)

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:27.304
Avoid his breath.

00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:29.144
It will be deadly at this stage.

00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:32.564
What chance does he have?

00:22:36.397 --> 00:22:38.616
He might survive the fever,
but this arm...

00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:39.774
Is it gangrene?

00:22:43.112 --> 00:22:44.284
It must come off.

00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:50.453
He won't survive.

00:22:51.871 --> 00:22:53.373
I beg you to try.

00:22:57.376 --> 00:22:58.878
I'll help you.

00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:07.140
ROSS: Be brave now, Jim.

00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:09.897
Think of Jinny waiting at home.

00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:32.996
It's all right, Jinny...

00:23:33.162 --> 00:23:34.505
(gasping): I'm coming home...

00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:36.961
I'm coming home...

00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:40.253
I'm coming home.

00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:46.722
(baby fussing)

00:24:26.548 --> 00:24:28.221
(crackling)

00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:07.386
ROSS: We buried him by the sea.

00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:13.683
If you'd seen his face,
Demelza...

00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:15.814
I think he knew me.

00:25:17.474 --> 00:25:21.524
He smiled
and tried to speak, but...

00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:30.580
The magistrate
should have been there.

00:25:30.738 --> 00:25:35.744
Smug, self-satisfied upholders
of the law.

00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:38.628
And so-called gentlemen!

00:25:38.787 --> 00:25:41.666
Who prize game
above honest working men.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.212
He tried to feed his family.

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:47.504
How is that a crime?

00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:52.559
By God, I could commit
murder myself.

00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:54.186
Will there not be trouble?

00:25:54.344 --> 00:25:55.687
That you broke the jail
and helped a prisoner escape?

00:25:55.846 --> 00:25:57.564
Let there be.

00:25:57.723 --> 00:25:59.521
I welcome it.

00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:01.856
I could almost be induced to go
amongst them tonight to the ball

00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:03.737
if I thought I might infect
them.

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:08.776
You mean not to go, then?

00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:11.240
How could we?

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:12.825
To dance and smile

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:14.831
at the very men to blame
for Jim's death?

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.118
No, no...

00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:18.786
We could not go, I do see that.

00:26:18.952 --> 00:26:20.044
(door opens)

00:26:20.204 --> 00:26:23.003
Parcel come for... Mistress.

00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:26.835
'Tis from the dressmakers.

00:26:29.713 --> 00:26:31.135
It is a mistake.

00:26:31.298 --> 00:26:34.598
I called on my way
to Bodmin to order it.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.434
It seems like 100 years ago now.

00:26:38.889 --> 00:26:40.015
Oh.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.409
Could I see it?

00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:52.365
If you've the interest.

00:26:54.863 --> 00:26:58.913
It will do for some time
in the future.

00:27:17.344 --> 00:27:19.062
Oh, Ross...

00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:40.750
(knocking)

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:47.086
I couldn't sleep.

00:27:47.249 --> 00:27:48.876
All last night,
I was thinking of you

00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:50.482
giving me something
to ease the pain.

00:27:56.633 --> 00:27:59.933
Uh, please wait here,
I'll fetch you something.

00:28:34.296 --> 00:28:36.390
Miss Verity, sir.

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:37.788
Oh, my dears, I heard about Jim.

00:28:37.841 --> 00:28:39.434
Say nothing, Verity.

00:28:39.593 --> 00:28:43.393
If I'm forced to relive it,
I'm like to explode.

00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:46.775
You must compose yourself

00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:48.060
before the ball.

00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:51.438
Do you know
who will attend this ball?

00:28:51.605 --> 00:28:54.950
Every single one of those men
who condemned Jim to die.

00:28:55.108 --> 00:28:56.828
So how do you imagine
I could go among them?

00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.865
Because you must go among them.

00:29:01.031 --> 00:29:04.535
Your move in forcing the jail
was reckless and unlawful.

00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:06.749
Your presence among these people
tonight will remind them

00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:09.665
that you are one of them,
a gentleman.

00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.630
It may make them think twice
before moving against you.

00:29:12.793 --> 00:29:15.171
Your arguments disgust me.

00:29:15.337 --> 00:29:18.341
They disgust me, too.

00:29:18.507 --> 00:29:21.932
But you have more than yourself
to consider now.

00:29:26.473 --> 00:29:27.816
My wife and child...

00:29:27.975 --> 00:29:29.272
Would suffer.

00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:32.904
As Jinny suffers.

00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:36.195
(sighs deeply)

00:29:36.358 --> 00:29:39.783
Justice is a fine thing,
is it not?

00:30:03.844 --> 00:30:07.940
(echoes of guests chattering)

00:30:23.613 --> 00:30:25.035
Ross!

00:30:25.198 --> 00:30:26.871
Where are you going?

00:30:27.034 --> 00:30:30.163
To acquaint myself with as much
brandy as George can supply.

00:30:34.708 --> 00:30:37.211
We shouldn't have come.

00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:40.847
Ross hasn't been sober since
he got back from Bodmin.

00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:46.140
For you, I think.

00:30:50.766 --> 00:30:52.063
It's from Ross.

00:31:04.738 --> 00:31:07.161
But how can I wear it?

00:31:07.324 --> 00:31:09.167
With Jim in the ground
and Jinny all bereft.

00:31:09.326 --> 00:31:12.045
You cannot help them, my dear.

00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:15.799
But you can try to keep a lid
on that powderkeg below.

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:21.968
(dance music playing)

00:31:29.638 --> 00:31:30.730
ls there a war on?

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:32.061
(chuckles)

00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:34.226
The Poldark cousins seem
hell-bent on battle.

00:31:34.393 --> 00:31:36.020
I cannot speak for Ross,

00:31:36.186 --> 00:31:38.188
but Francis is most definitely
at odds with all the world.

00:31:38.355 --> 00:31:39.652
(both chuckle)

00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:45.236
There, now.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.322
Look how lovely you look.

00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:48.661
Let us go down.

00:31:48.824 --> 00:31:50.622
It will take us both
to keep Ross in check.

00:31:50.784 --> 00:31:52.081
You won't desert me?

00:31:52.244 --> 00:31:54.292
I would not dream of such.

00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:55.626
Oh, dear God!

00:31:58.291 --> 00:31:59.291
I must go to him.

00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:00.920
He must leave at once.

00:32:35.579 --> 00:32:37.502
Dwight, I feared
I wouldn't know a soul.

00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:40.167
Here is a gentleman eager
to make your acquaintance.

00:32:40.333 --> 00:32:44.964
Sir Hugh Bodregun, may I present
Mistress Demelza Poldark.

00:32:46.756 --> 00:32:49.475
Enys tells me we're neighbors.

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:53.264
How could I come to overlook
such a bloom, hmm?

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:55.558
I cannot account for it, sir.

00:32:55.724 --> 00:32:57.943
Do you hunt, ma'am?

00:32:58.101 --> 00:33:00.445
No, sir.

00:33:00.604 --> 00:33:02.902
I have some sympathy
for the foxes.

00:33:03.064 --> 00:33:04.782
(chuckles)

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.577
Please, Andrew...

00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:16.748
Ross.

00:33:16.912 --> 00:33:17.913
<i>Hm'?</i>

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:19.001
I've been singing your praises.

00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:21.007
To whom?

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:22.383
Mr. Matthew Sanson.

00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:24.965
He's keen to test his mettle
against you.

00:33:25.128 --> 00:33:26.300
Oh, thank you.

00:33:26.463 --> 00:33:27.885
I have no taste
for gaming tonight.

00:33:28.048 --> 00:33:29.516
Oh, that's a pity.

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:31.017
Last time he played, he had
the better of the Poldarks.

00:33:31.176 --> 00:33:32.519
I thought you might care
to level the scores.

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:33.677
He may try.

00:33:33.762 --> 00:33:37.187
I'm here to escort my wife.

00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:39.829
That being so, it wouldn't suit
my purpose to spend the evening

00:33:39.935 --> 00:33:40.982
in a card room.

00:33:42.229 --> 00:33:43.902
Which is your wife?

00:33:44.064 --> 00:33:45.691
I should like the pleasure.

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:48.610
She's over there.

00:33:50.654 --> 00:33:53.248
And she seems very well attended
by Sir Hugh Bodregun.

00:33:53.406 --> 00:33:55.283
Might I suggest
a short game, just...

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.248
while the evening warms up?

00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:01.085
As you wish.

00:34:01.248 --> 00:34:02.545
Please.

00:34:07.504 --> 00:34:10.132
Did you not hear?

00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:12.392
Since Francis lost the mine,

00:34:12.551 --> 00:34:15.896
that woman has thrown him over.

00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:19.103
Now he can't even afford
a new dress for his wife.

00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:25.814
And as for Ross, no doubt
regretting his marriage

00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:27.153
to that hussy...

00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:36.954
(dance music begins)

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.556
Andrew, I beg you to leave.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:56.811
Francis will see you.

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:58.050
That's exactly what I wish.

00:34:58.179 --> 00:34:59.299
Have it all out in the open.

00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:00.667
I will not be ashamed
of our love.

00:35:00.724 --> 00:35:02.192
Nor I!

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.318
But if we're seen together,
it will be a disaster.

00:35:04.477 --> 00:35:06.275
Who's to say Francis
would make difficulties?

00:35:06.438 --> 00:35:07.860
Has he not grown up?

00:35:08.023 --> 00:35:09.275
Might he not have mellowed?

00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:10.738
Let him once catch sight of you

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.823
and you will see
how much he's mellowed.

00:35:26.249 --> 00:35:29.753
Who is that young person dancing
with Sir Hugh?

00:35:29.919 --> 00:35:31.637
She's quite lovely,
don't you think?

00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:34.094
That's Demelza, Mama.

00:35:34.257 --> 00:35:35.725
Ross's wife.

00:35:37.594 --> 00:35:39.972
The scullery maid!

00:35:42.265 --> 00:35:45.144
I see no scullery maid, Mama.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.152
Reverend Halse.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.163
Will you join us?

00:36:00.408 --> 00:36:02.035
What are the stakes?

00:36:02.202 --> 00:36:04.421
A... guinea.

00:36:06.581 --> 00:36:08.299
It's more than
my customary stake.

00:36:08.458 --> 00:36:10.756
Perhaps you'd prefer to wait
for another table.

00:36:10.919 --> 00:36:13.422
I think not.

00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:17.468
I have as much right to call
the stakes as any here.

00:36:17.634 --> 00:36:18.931
Half a guinea, let it be.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:35.490
(music continues)

00:36:42.075 --> 00:36:44.749
Still not dancing, Elizabeth?

00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:46.663
What will people say?

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.959
Your first outing in months and
to be so neglected by Francis.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:58.760
Elizabeth, will you grant me
the favor of the next dance?

00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:01.974
How charming you
look tonight, ma'am.

00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:04.231
I swear Elizabeth's place
will be taken

00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:06.187
the moment I lead her away.

00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:11.396
(sighs)

00:37:11.563 --> 00:37:15.409
Wicked shame to have thrown her
away on a Poldark.

00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:31.717
You did not return
my trump lead, sir.

00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:34.424
It is an elementary principle
to return one's partner's lead.

00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:37.840
Thank you, I'm acquainted with
the elementary principles.

00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:39.349
ROSS: No doubt your partner has

00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:41.680
all the principles
at his fingertips.

00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:43.595
It's a general misfortune

00:37:43.762 --> 00:37:45.162
he does not make
better use of them.

00:37:45.305 --> 00:37:48.559
Manners were never
your strong suit, Poldark.

00:37:48.725 --> 00:37:50.477
Who can only guess
at the bad humors

00:37:50.643 --> 00:37:52.111
that come
from an ill-spent life?

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.648
Ill-spent?

00:37:54.814 --> 00:37:56.782
And this from a justice
of the peace who combines

00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:00.445
all the virtues of office except
perhaps justice and peace?

00:38:00.612 --> 00:38:02.330
No doubt
the common people you mix with

00:38:02.489 --> 00:38:04.036
have blunted your faculties

00:38:04.199 --> 00:38:08.295
<i>as</i> to what may or may not be
said in polite society.

00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:11.627
I agree, they alter one's
perspectives, sir.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.633
You should try mixing
with such people.

00:38:13.792 --> 00:38:14.992
It might enlarge your outlook.

00:38:15.084 --> 00:38:18.133
I think I will find
another table.

00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:21.266
Have you ever been
in a jail, sir'?

00:38:21.424 --> 00:38:23.677
It's surprising the stench

00:38:23.843 --> 00:38:26.722
30 or 40 of God's creatures
can give off

00:38:26.888 --> 00:38:28.435
when confined to a squalid pit
for months on end

00:38:28.598 --> 00:38:30.942
without drains, water,
physicians, care.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.444
The matter of your performance
at Bodmin jail

00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:35.446
has not gone unnoticed, sir.

00:38:35.605 --> 00:38:37.485
There will shortly be a meeting
of the justices,

00:38:37.565 --> 00:38:39.192
of whom, may I say, I am one.

00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:40.611
Then pray convey this message:

00:38:40.777 --> 00:38:43.200
That it would give me
great pleasure

00:38:43.363 --> 00:38:45.331
to meet any of you
who can spare the time

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.458
from your high offices
and holy livings.

00:38:47.617 --> 00:38:49.790
Especially those responsible
for the upkeep of Bodmin jail.

00:38:49.953 --> 00:38:52.251
You offensive young drunkard!

00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:58.212
You'll be hearing
from us presently.

00:38:58.378 --> 00:38:59.846
Continue.

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:03.008
Come, Mr. Francis,
follow your cousin's lead.

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:05.643
Lay a stake
on the queen of spades.

00:39:05.802 --> 00:39:08.897
Thank you, I've learned
never to stake on women.

00:39:11.975 --> 00:39:14.194
Excuse me, I'll have a...
breath of air.

00:39:26.906 --> 00:39:29.500
(music ends, applause)

00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:33.546
You look ravishing tonight,
Elizabeth.

00:39:33.705 --> 00:39:36.549
If I were a poet or a painter,
I could do you justice.

00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:38.710
You're very kind, George,

00:39:38.877 --> 00:39:41.551
but I'm afraid you have little
reward for your attentions.

00:39:41.713 --> 00:39:43.340
I'm a dull creature these days.

00:39:43.506 --> 00:39:47.056
That which is treasured
can never be dull.

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:49.266
You should venture out more.

00:39:49.429 --> 00:39:50.976
And bring Francis, if you will.

00:39:51.139 --> 00:39:52.982
To the gaming tables?

00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:55.769
It's the only reward
for the end of Grambler,

00:39:55.935 --> 00:39:57.562
that he sees less
of the green cloths

00:39:57.729 --> 00:39:59.322
and more of his family.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.653
If I were to promise
never to encourage

00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:05.912
or even play with Francis again,
would that please you?

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.913
We both know he will
continue to play,

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.699
whether you encourage him
or not.

00:40:09.866 --> 00:40:11.834
He cannot help himself.

00:40:11.993 --> 00:40:13.336
Any more than I can.

00:40:17.582 --> 00:40:19.425
Some... refreshment?

00:40:34.933 --> 00:40:36.776
(sobbing)

00:40:52.617 --> 00:40:54.085
I hope you will do me
the honor of allowing...

00:40:54.243 --> 00:40:56.416
How dare you address me!

00:40:56.579 --> 00:40:57.579
Francis!

00:40:57.664 --> 00:40:59.041
Your sister deserves better.

00:40:59.207 --> 00:41:01.175
I beg you, let us
resolve this peaceably...

00:41:01.334 --> 00:41:02.756
Step aside!

00:41:02.919 --> 00:41:05.342
Your sister is not
to be commanded.

00:41:05.505 --> 00:41:06.927
Nor am I.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.718
Then perhaps you will take this
as an inducement.

00:41:27.026 --> 00:41:29.700
I forbid you ever
to see him again.

00:41:41.874 --> 00:41:43.626
Er, no, thank you.

00:41:50.466 --> 00:41:51.934
Excuse me, sirs.

00:41:52.093 --> 00:41:53.310
I must speak with my cousin.

00:41:53.469 --> 00:41:57.099
Oh, no, no, not so fast, missy.

00:41:57.265 --> 00:41:59.859
I haven't had the pleasure
of my second dance.

00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:01.110
Nor I, indeed.

00:42:01.269 --> 00:42:02.737
Excuse me, sirs, I cannot stay.

00:42:02.895 --> 00:42:05.614
We've been admiring
your gown, Demelza.

00:42:05.773 --> 00:42:07.491
Mama thought it had come
from London

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:10.494
until Mrs. Treneglos
assured her to the contrary.

00:42:10.653 --> 00:42:12.747
And how is your father, dear?

00:42:12.905 --> 00:42:14.907
We've not seen him
since the christening.

00:42:15.074 --> 00:42:18.419
No, ma'am, I'm sorry.

00:42:18.578 --> 00:42:21.798
Father is overparticular
who he meets.

00:42:29.756 --> 00:42:30.848
He despises me.

00:42:31.007 --> 00:42:32.224
No.

00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:34.431
And so he should.

00:42:34.594 --> 00:42:36.392
I am to blame.

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:40.934
I should have told Francis
when I had the chance.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.024
But I was timid.

00:42:44.187 --> 00:42:46.064
It's the one weakness
Andrew cannot abide.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.983
He will forgive you.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:52.279
He left...
without a backward glance.

00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:57.618
I shall never see him again.

00:43:08.086 --> 00:43:09.212
Propose.

00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:13.683
Two.

00:43:25.311 --> 00:43:27.313
I hope you're as well
entertained as your wife.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:31.030
Or had you forgot her existence?

00:43:31.192 --> 00:43:32.535
Dangerous mistake.

00:43:32.693 --> 00:43:34.536
Absentee husbands make
for wandering wives.

00:43:34.695 --> 00:43:36.493
If you wish to retain our favor,

00:43:36.656 --> 00:43:38.750
you'd do well to pay it
attention.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.588
Ah! I'm determined, ma'am.

00:43:51.754 --> 00:43:52.846
The next dance is mine.

00:43:53.005 --> 00:43:53.847
ROSS: Forgive me.

00:43:54.006 --> 00:43:55.006
Pardon me.

00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:56.551
I came to see if you
require anything.

00:43:56.717 --> 00:43:58.765
BODRUGAN: It's a bit
late to be showing

00:43:58.928 --> 00:44:00.528
a lively concern
for your wife, isn't it?

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.149
Better a belated conscience
than none at all.

00:44:06.352 --> 00:44:07.899
Hm!

00:44:08.062 --> 00:44:10.360
DEMELZA: Perhaps I should
ask for an introduction,

00:44:10.523 --> 00:44:12.321
as it's so long since we've met.

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:15.111
I hear you've been
well consoled in my absence.

00:44:16.946 --> 00:44:19.540
Look at them all.

00:44:19.699 --> 00:44:21.872
Overpainted, overdressed...

00:44:22.034 --> 00:44:23.206
Overstuffed.

00:44:25.037 --> 00:44:28.587
If these are my people,
I'm ashamed to belong to them.

00:44:28.749 --> 00:44:30.672
Well, if you think all
the stupid, fat ignorants

00:44:30.835 --> 00:44:33.258
are in your class,
then you're mistook.

00:44:33.421 --> 00:44:36.345
I've lived long enough to know
that they're everywhere.

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.760
And you'll not right any wrongs

00:44:38.926 --> 00:44:41.349
by blaming just these folk
for Jim dying.

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:43.014
Of course they're to blame!

00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:46.276
For their ignorance,
their selfishness,

00:44:46.434 --> 00:44:47.526
their arrogance...

00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:48.937
And you'll not right any wrongs

00:44:49.103 --> 00:44:50.229
by drinking and gaming

00:44:50.396 --> 00:44:51.864
and leaving me
to fend for myself

00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:54.196
at my very first ball!

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:56.702
If you behave like this,
you'll not come to another.

00:44:56.861 --> 00:44:58.829
If you behave like this,
I'll not want to.

00:45:04.827 --> 00:45:06.295
(dancers applaud as music ends)

00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:11.005
Would you care to dance?

00:45:11.167 --> 00:45:12.419
No, thank you.

00:45:26.599 --> 00:45:29.318
Poldark's losing badly.

00:45:55.044 --> 00:45:56.717
50 guineas?

00:46:02.677 --> 00:46:04.475
Agreed.

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:25.082
I propose...

00:46:25.241 --> 00:46:26.241
How many?

00:46:26.284 --> 00:46:27.331
The book.

00:46:30.288 --> 00:46:31.288
I'll take two.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.518
Propose.

00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:47.646
Accept.

00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:49.557
Two.

00:46:53.561 --> 00:46:56.314
I'll lay ten guineas.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.948
Twenty.

00:47:03.612 --> 00:47:05.205
I'll take it.

00:47:46.906 --> 00:47:49.409
The luck of the devil.

00:47:49.575 --> 00:47:51.498
This is a decent little piece.

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.082
Somewhat high priced.

00:47:55.247 --> 00:47:56.965
I trust it keeps good time?

00:47:57.124 --> 00:47:58.467
It never failed my grandfather.

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:00.760
Shall we continue?

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.638
And what do you intend
to play with?

00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:04.549
Assets I can realize.

00:48:06.008 --> 00:48:07.008
Ross, no.

00:48:14.934 --> 00:48:16.732
Play with this if you must.

00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:20.697
And what is this worth?

00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:22.991
About 100.

00:48:25.653 --> 00:48:27.326
(softly): Oh, Ross.

00:48:27.488 --> 00:48:29.536
Well?

00:48:33.536 --> 00:48:35.254
Deal.

00:49:17.872 --> 00:49:19.874
He's met his match in Matthew.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.040
<i>Hm.</i>

00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:42.313
<i>Hm.</i>

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.697
Shall we retire?

00:49:43.856 --> 00:49:45.403
Another hour.

00:49:45.566 --> 00:49:47.113
With what?

00:49:47.276 --> 00:49:50.780
My stake in Wheal Leisure.

00:49:56.535 --> 00:49:58.128
Ross, no.

00:50:17.806 --> 00:50:19.683
I propose.

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:22.685
How many?

00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:23.811
One.

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.778
I'll take the book.

00:50:35.407 --> 00:50:39.037
Can you explain how you come
to have a card in your hand

00:50:39.203 --> 00:50:40.876
before you drew one
from the pack?

00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:42.038
You're mistaken.

00:50:42.122 --> 00:50:44.124
I'd already drawn.

00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:45.042
I rather think he had, Ross.

00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:46.677
Oh, no, he had not.

00:50:46.835 --> 00:50:47.875
He most certainly had not.

00:50:55.177 --> 00:50:56.895
What the hell are you doing,
Ross?

00:50:57.054 --> 00:50:59.307
George! Cary!

00:50:59.473 --> 00:51:01.191
Will you permit this?!

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:02.897
I'm sorry for assaulting
your friend, George,

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.404
but if you insist on
entertaining such fellows,

00:51:05.563 --> 00:51:07.163
you should at least
keep them on a leash.

00:51:09.858 --> 00:51:13.488
Or perhaps you prefer your
guests to be ruined in silence?

00:51:43.392 --> 00:51:46.316
When did you first know
he was cheating?

00:51:46.478 --> 00:51:48.480
Almost at once.

00:51:48.647 --> 00:51:50.945
But I wanted to be sure
before I challenged him.

00:52:02.328 --> 00:52:03.420
Thank you.

00:52:05.706 --> 00:52:08.880
Your exploits at Bodmin jail
were much discussed.

00:52:09.043 --> 00:52:11.137
No doubt.

00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:13.297
There was some sympathy
for your intentions.

00:52:13.464 --> 00:52:14.841
Though not our actions.

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.901
Pity some of your partners
at Carnmore should be

00:52:30.064 --> 00:52:31.407
on the other side of the bench.

00:52:31.565 --> 00:52:33.283
How do you mean?

00:52:33.442 --> 00:52:36.070
St. Aubyn Tresize,
Alfred Barbary...

00:52:36.236 --> 00:52:39.957
They're magistrates,
are they not?

00:52:40.115 --> 00:52:41.742
They may feel compelled
to take a stand.

00:52:43.327 --> 00:52:45.421
And then there's the matter
of Matthew Sanson.

00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:46.705
What of him?

00:52:49.083 --> 00:52:51.711
Once this tale gets out,

00:52:51.877 --> 00:52:53.595
George may feel obliged
to respond.

00:52:53.754 --> 00:52:56.007
Why should he?

00:52:56.173 --> 00:52:58.426
Matthew's a cousin.

00:52:58.592 --> 00:52:59.935
Did you not know?

00:53:04.348 --> 00:53:05.565
No, I did not.

00:53:10.938 --> 00:53:12.736
(thunder)

00:53:27.538 --> 00:53:29.336
Old tripe-for-brains be within.

00:53:30.791 --> 00:53:32.043
Who?

00:53:32.209 --> 00:53:33.631
Mark Daniel, moping and moaning

00:53:33.794 --> 00:53:36.047
fit to make your lugs bleed.

00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:39.513
There's talk of Keren
and Dwight.

00:53:39.675 --> 00:53:41.018
Any truth in it?

00:53:41.176 --> 00:53:43.224
Couldn't say.

00:53:43.387 --> 00:53:45.060
Anything else we can't say?

00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:48.772
About Verity, Blarney...?

00:53:48.934 --> 00:53:50.857
I know <i>as</i> much as you.

00:53:59.403 --> 00:54:01.576
ANDREW: <i>"Since you brought
Verity and me together,</i>

00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:03.958
<i>"I must tum to you
for further help.</i>

00:54:04.116 --> 00:54:06.369
<i>"Francis is impossible.</i>

00:54:06.535 --> 00:54:08.458
<i>"There can never be
a reconciliation.</i>

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:12.375
<i>Therefore, Verity must choose
between us."</i>

00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:15.420
Folks say she's brazen.

00:54:15.586 --> 00:54:16.803
That she'll fling herself
at other men.

00:54:16.962 --> 00:54:18.635
Have you asked her if it's true?

00:54:18.797 --> 00:54:21.801
I haven't the heart to, Ross.

00:54:21.967 --> 00:54:23.765
I can't put myself
to believe it.

00:54:26.597 --> 00:54:29.350
But if a man can't
trust his wife...

00:54:29.516 --> 00:54:30.984
You must have faith, Mark.

00:54:31.143 --> 00:54:34.397
Without that, there's
no hope for a marriage.

00:54:34.563 --> 00:54:35.405
JUD: Hope for marriage?

00:54:35.564 --> 00:54:37.407
Pick me liver.

00:54:37.566 --> 00:54:40.661
Best take it out 'fore it's not
to be cuckolded thrice a day

00:54:40.819 --> 00:54:42.419
by every man, dog and mule
in the county.

00:54:42.529 --> 00:54:44.202
(clears his throat)

00:54:57.336 --> 00:54:58.462
(knocks)

00:55:02.674 --> 00:55:03.721
I come to offer myself.

00:55:03.884 --> 00:55:05.852
To help you with your work.

00:55:06.011 --> 00:55:08.389
I can write, I can take notes.

00:55:08.555 --> 00:55:09.647
But...

00:55:09.807 --> 00:55:10.807
Oh, don't refuse me.

00:55:10.933 --> 00:55:12.935
You've been so kind.

00:55:13.101 --> 00:55:15.103
I must use my wits for
something, or I'll go mad.

00:55:26.949 --> 00:55:29.828
It is an omen, mark my words!

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:32.746
It is a fiendish, black omen!

00:55:32.913 --> 00:55:35.917
What is the matter with
the women of this family?

00:55:37.626 --> 00:55:39.924
The men.

00:55:43.423 --> 00:55:44.845
You think you could do better?

00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:55.352
<i>"CARY". What do we know?</i>

00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:58.022
What we know is
that Ross Poldark,

00:55:58.188 --> 00:55:59.815
though clever, has a weakness.

00:55:59.982 --> 00:56:00.982
Just the one?

00:56:01.066 --> 00:56:03.444
He plays it straight.

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.203
And trusts others
to do the same,

00:56:05.362 --> 00:56:08.411
but others have eyes and ears.

00:56:08.574 --> 00:56:10.076
And they report.

00:56:10.242 --> 00:56:12.290
What we've been trying
for some time to find out,

00:56:12.452 --> 00:56:15.797
the site of the Carnmore Copper
Company smelting works.

00:56:15.956 --> 00:56:16.956
And?

00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:25.132
Trevaunance land.

00:56:25.299 --> 00:56:27.643
They've struck a deal
with Tresidder's Mill.

00:56:30.679 --> 00:56:32.839
<i>GEORGE: For now, they have
enough copper to keep going,</i>

00:56:32.931 --> 00:56:35.104
<i>but come the next auction...</i>

00:56:35.267 --> 00:56:37.190
CARY: <i>We'll see they
come away empty-handed.</i>

00:56:40.522 --> 00:56:42.741
And the question is, will that
be enough to ruin them?

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.904
What more can we do, since
they deliberately withhold

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:47.036
the names of their shareholders?

00:56:47.195 --> 00:56:48.913
There's no law against that.

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:50.870
It makes it considerably
more difficult

00:56:51.033 --> 00:56:53.286
for us to exert pressure.

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:59.626
So... let's begin with the one
name we do know...

00:56:59.791 --> 00:57:01.213
Jonathan Tresidder.

00:57:01.376 --> 00:57:03.299
<i>Banks with us, does he not?</i>

00:57:03.462 --> 00:57:05.510
<i>CARY: He does indeed.</i>

00:57:05.672 --> 00:57:08.300
<i>"GEORGE".
And has substantial loans.</i>

00:57:08.467 --> 00:57:10.936
<i>Here's to the first chink</i>

00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:12.391
in the Poldark armor.

00:57:12.554 --> 00:57:14.147
(Clink)

00:57:24.775 --> 00:57:26.743
(baby crying)

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:48.928
I wish Jim could have seen
his child grow up.

00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:51.844
You did all you could.

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:53.136
I wonder.

00:57:55.931 --> 00:57:59.936
Ross, you cannot fight
all the world.

00:58:00.102 --> 00:58:03.197
You can only make your own
small corner a fairer place.

00:58:46.898 --> 00:58:49.822
Will anything come
of what you did?

00:58:49.985 --> 00:58:52.113
It may. It may not.

00:58:53.488 --> 00:58:54.660
Lay your flowers.

00:58:57.451 --> 00:59:01.001
This is the first time
I've been sober in five days.
