00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.505


00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.326
<i>JUD: Isn't right.</i>

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:16.618
<i>PRUDE: Isn't fair.</i>

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.037
Isn't fit.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:19.455
Isn't proper.

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.749
Won't last. Won't work.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.132
Who does she think she is?

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:24.418
Who does he think she is?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.347
<i>JUD: A chit of a girl.</i>

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:36.388
She'll be too grand to skivvy.

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.478
Too common to curtsy.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.768
'Tis all cocky-eyed.

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:52.742
He's late tonight, Garrick.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.077
Where can he be?

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.576
Sir!

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:42.829
Ross.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.633
I was thinking you might
stop over in town.

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.715
I have a home, do I not?

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.299
And a wife.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.098
I just sometimes forget.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.351
That I live here?

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.137
That I'm your wife.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:02:59.930
Well, let this be a reminder.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:07.567
Why are you up so late?

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.106
I have chores.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.694
Suppose I have
other plans for you?

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.780
Tell me.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.707
<i>Yes, Ross'?</i>

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:24.546
Folks will wonder.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:25.877
They'll not understand.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.256
I don't rightly understand.

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:28.508
What?

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.089
How it came to happen.

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:31.344
This.

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:32.595
We.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.301
You're not required
to understand.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:37.809
You're required to accept it
as a fact of life.

00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:40.642
So it's not to be a secret?

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.181
Why should it?

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:57.996
Good day, ladies.

00:03:58.155 --> 00:03:59.998
Are we expecting a storm?

00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:01.830
Storm of pilchards, God willing!

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:04.086
They're late this year.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.871
And we do fear they missed us
entirely

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.414
and swung away to Ireland.

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:08.798
If that happens
you'll have nothing to see you

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.049
through winter.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.300
And we'll starve.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.212
Simple as that.

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.716
Let's hope it won't
come to that.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.054
I'm not a magician, sir!

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.768
I cannot conjure wages
out of thin air!

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.729
The men must wait.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.738
Did my father send you?

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:36.993
Why would he?

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:38.244
Read me the riot act?

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:39.563
Tell me what I'm doing wrong?

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.452
Or was it my wife?

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.788
Does she think I'm falling
short of the mark?

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.577
Is she wrong to be concerned?

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.371
What she doesn't know
won't hurt her.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:48.754
What she suspects, might.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.383
Gaming?

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.010
Whoring?

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.889
What gentleman doesn't
occasionally indulge?

00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:57.673
This one.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:58.931
Since when?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.467
Since my wedding.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.942
<i>FRANCE: Your kitchen maid?</i>

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.027
But Ross, surely you must see...

00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:24.826
With such a wife you cannot
hope to have entry

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.790
into any respectable gathering?

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:29.626
You will cut yourself
out of society,

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.756
consign yourself to...

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:34.509
A life of peace and seclusion?

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.966
I must try to bear it
as best I can.

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.381
May I leave you to share
the glad tidings at Trenwith?

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.359
Demelza?

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.988
(coughing):
Damn me, he's done it now!

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:56.648
What the devil
can he mean by it?

00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:02.079
I never thought you
the marrying kind.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.456
Is she wealthy?

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.082
Not at all.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.618
<i>"GEORGE".
He could've had his pick.</i>

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.663
Any number of eligible girls
from rising families.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:14.174
Instead of which,
he marries his serving Wench?

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:16.426
It beggars belief.

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:17.802
It may beggar him.

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.963
He must be deranged.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.804
How else could he lower
his sights so abominably?

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.513
Is she beautiful?

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.934
In a way.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:29.313
In spite of all our assets,

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.349
we Warleggans struggle
to pass muster.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:34.520
How will he fare
with a scullery maid on his arm?

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:36.188
MRS. WARLEGGAN: <i>His family
will never forgive him.</i>

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.449
Society will never forgive him.

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:41.808
CARY: <i>Doors which were open
will be slammed in his face.</i>

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:44.451
His ventures will fail...

00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:46.832
And you can enjoy the sight
of him in the gutter,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.833
along with his slut.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.120
So you love her?

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:53.834
We get on.

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.512
VERITY: "My dear Ross,
I am the last person"

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.048
"to criticize your attachment.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:05.558
"But I would like to be
the first to write to you

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.219
and wish you joy."

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.545
POLDARK: "I am presently taken
up with tending father",

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:13.604
but I hope soon to call to offer
my felicitations in person."

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.144
There.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.482
We have at least one friend.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.114
"Calling"?

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.367
Who has time to call?

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:23.617
What do they mean by it?

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.324
"Calling"?

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:27.410
I'll call 'em!

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.795
What?

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:35.994
You been giving me squinty-eye
ever since I got back

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.131
from church.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.963
How else we must look?

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.798
We don't rightly know
who we looking at!

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:44.386
One minute she Miss Skivvily-
Scullery-Kitchen-Maid,

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.265
next she be
Mistress High and Mighty!

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:50.395
Do you think it's not as strange
to me <i>as</i> it is to you?

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:55.480
Do you imagine I ever
looked for or expected it'?

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.736
Come to think of it, 'tis
more your fault than mine!

00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:58.941
How be that, then?

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.152
'Tis you have raised me up
and taught me all I know.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:04.909
So if I'm fit for better
than I'd hoped,

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:07.662
blame yourselves
for educating me!

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.328
We?

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.711
"Educators"?

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.122
We made her what she is?

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:19.086
She have we to thank for her.

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.835
She still do all her chores.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.219
And most of yours.

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:24.698
And 'tis better
than taking orders

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.132
from some fudgy-faced baggage
with drop curls.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:40.650
POLDARK: Damn this ironstone,
is there no end to it?

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.235
How long till we strike copper?

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:49.700
If we strike copper,
it could be months.

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.160
Can we last?

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.074
With good will and good men.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.868
And the power of luck beside.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.538
We will need a rise
in the price of ore.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:59.001
Else we are all
wasting our time.

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:25.485
This shareholders meeting.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:28.618
Not a prospect I relish.

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:31.200
We're no closer to copper,
so I must appeal

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:33.282
for further investment
if we're to keep blasting.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:37.123
But are they not
friends of yours?

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.629
If ever they were, they're
reconsidering the connection.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:59.951
I would that I had
nothing better to do

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:03.236
than admire the view.

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:05.396
They'd happily swap places
with you, sir.

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.691
You have means
to last the winter.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.177
Without the pilchards
they do not.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.866
Those who cannot feed
should not breed.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.952
PASCOE: I believe
felicitations are in order.

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.163
Your son John?

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:18.417
Recently wed?

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:19.668
To Miss Ruth Teague.

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:22.081
A determined girl.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.215
My best wishes to them both.

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:26.502
But are we not remiss
overlooking the presence

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.966
of a bridegroom in our midst?

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.507
Oh yes, indeed, indeed.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.346
Congratulations,
Captain Poldark.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:36.387
You have our best wishes for you
and your young bride.

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.100
I thank you, gentlemen.

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:40.812
Now if you'll excuse me,
I must consult Captain Henshawe

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:42.567
before our meeting.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.867
I confess myself uneasy.

00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:53.619
His early skirmishes
with the law.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.997
His contempt of court
at the last assizes.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.500
Now this marriage
to his serving Wench.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.080
You think him foolish?

00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:02.211
I think him reckless
in the extreme.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.293
Is a man that demonstrates
such a spectacular

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:06.332
lack of judgment to be trusted?

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.469
Is he fit to helm a venture
of such risk as a mine?

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.971
More to the point,
am I prepared to trust him

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.599
with more of my capital?

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:16.680
I am not, sir.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.471
I can see no reason for pouring
good money after bad.

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:22.390
Come to me when you've struck
copper and I may reconsider.

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:25.356
Till then you'll see no more
of me or my guineas.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.898
The rest of you share
his opinion?

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:37.539
I do not.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:38.994
Nor do I.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:42.877
POLDARK: Gentlemen, thank you.

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.289
I'm sorry we could not bring you
better reports.

00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:01.145
You got the candles and twine?

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:02.601
And the muslin for the cheese?

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:04.892
Open it.

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:14.784
A book for you.

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.071
To practice your letters.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:20.992
And ribbons to tie up
that unruly mane.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.784
I know little of these things.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.170
If they don't suit,
give them to Prudie.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:28.790
Did I mention I wrote
to your father?

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.584
Oh Ross, you never!

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.503
He'll be that vexed,
thinking I'll never come home.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.343
I told him your duty lay here.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:39.601
Well, so it do, Ross.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.181
Nothing's changed.

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.017
Nothing?

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.523
I do get less sleep.

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:47.309
And that's your only complaint?

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:48.943
I have no complaints.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.153
I do, however.

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.531
Tell me.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.690
You have yet to make
an official visit to the mine.

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.161
Oh no, Ross, I couldn't,
how would it look?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.867
"Look"?

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.623
A kitchen maid
giving herself airs.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.079
I see no kitchen maid.

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:06.336
I see a wife whose duty
is to take an interest

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:07.586
in her husband's work.

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:09.213
I do take an interest!

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.374
Excellent,
first thing tomorrow, then.

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:14.840
Harder, damn it, push harder!

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:16.755
Is this wise, sir?

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.218
Can Grambler not wait
till you're stronger?

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:19.678
Dr. Choake ordered bed rest.

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:23.345
Choake doesn't have a failing
mine or a son who's neither use

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:24.728
nor ornament!

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:27.231
I'm touched
by your faith, father.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.813
Not sufficiently touched
to behave like a man

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.149
and the heir of Trenwith?

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.444
Father!

00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:52.540
I never knew such ironstone.

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:54.550
It's impenetrable.

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:58.009
Our luck has deserted us.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.851
Let's hope the pilchards
don't do likewise!

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:02.350
Mining and fishing
is our lifeblood.

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:04.556
Surely both won't fail.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.892
POLDARK: Captain Henshawe,
you know my wife Demelza?

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:13.278
A pleasure to see you, ma'am.

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.154
Good day to you, sir.

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:16.860
No sign of those shoals yet.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.195
Demelza's of
mining stock herself.

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.827
Her father's a tributer
at llluggan.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.908
Perhaps you'd like him
to join us here, ma'am?

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:26.416
I'd as lief stick a fork
in my eye!

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:33.632
We do get on better
from a distance, sir.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.134
I must be getting back.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:37.760
The pies'll be burning.

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:42.553
We hope to see you
here often, ma'am.

00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:49.935
DEMELZA: I was that
worried I'd show you up!

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.224
Why would you?

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:52.768
I've no notion how to be.

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.026
As you are.

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:56.313
What am I? A lady.

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:59.107
I'm not, and I don't know how.

00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:01.071
You're a quick learner.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:04.033
Nay, Ross, I came a day
at your behest,

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:07.699
but I shan't venture again.

00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:09.993
Miners are my own kind,
but I'd not be

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.287
so kindly received by yours.

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:14.713
Judas!

00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:16.715
I'll fetch him such a dusting!

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:18.547
Demelza! Oi! Guts!

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:19.426
Demelza!

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:22.054
Get back here, you
good-for-nothing viper!

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:23.806
Thieving, conniving!

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.600
Half a morn I labored
at that pie, you lizard!

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:30.558
Demelza, leave him be!

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:32.001
Think to fox me, would you, hmm?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.813
You'll have to be
quicker than that!

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:36.478
Damn me if a man can't take
a fair morsel now and then.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.521
I told you to stop,
did you not hear me?

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:40.065
Yes, but...

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:41.991
I cannot have my wife
wrestling a manservant.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.242
It's unbecoming.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.904
No, Ross.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.242
I see it is not dignified.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:50.666
I'll remember next time.

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.953
There'll be no next time.

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.923
There's only one way to remind
you you're no longer a servant.

00:15:58.082 --> 00:15:59.629
But you'll do all the arranging?

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.544
I will not.

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.179
You are mistress of Nampara.

00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:05.635
It's for you to engage
your own servants.

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:08.600
JINNY:
I'll serve you gladly, ma'am.

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:10.102
When shall you want me?

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:13.060
Tomorrow would be
quite convenient.

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.314
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:15.566
Thank you, ma'am.

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:24.449
Did she curtsy to me?

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:26.828
Get used to it.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.954
No... I never will.

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:30.831
I must visit my uncle,
perhaps it's time for you

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.583
to come with me.

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:35.040
No, no, no, I couldn't.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:39.549
There's... there's cows to be
meated and pastry to make.

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:41.004
From tomorrow that excuse
won't avail you.

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:03.322
How does the patient fare?

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:07.113
Lucky to have any blood left!

00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:09.028
Progress is excellent.

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.993
If he continues
with my treatment,

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.749
he can expect to eat
a hearty Christmas dinner!

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.002
But how will you manage, Ross,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.913
without a kitchen maid?

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.674
My wife has this very day
engaged another.

00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:25.503
The cheek of the devil.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.298
But your father
was no different!

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:31.434
The Nampara Poldarks
were renowned

00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:33.435
for their disregard
of convention.

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:35.221
Good day to you.

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.186
Mmm...

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:43.154
We're so delighted
by the news, Ross.

00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:45.690
Francis especially was quick
to see the advantage!

00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:46.948
Father.

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:48.108
Of what?

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.781
A wife to divert you.

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:53.539
He feels it marginally
less likely you'll ride over

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:54.995
and steal Elizabeth from him!

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:56.659
(laughs)

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.373
Father!

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:00.664
Compose yourself.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.252
(laughing continues)

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:03.667
Oh, my heart!

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.176
My heart, my heart!

00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:06.426
Fetch the doctor.

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:09.135
Damn, Choake, promised me
Christmas dinner!

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.677
(door opens)

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:25.234
He's asked to see you.

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:40.420
I've lost all faith in this
world of ours.

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:42.956
And my legacy!

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:49.337
We both know Francis
is not the man you are.

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:53.007
Uncle...

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.097
Look after him for me.

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:56.351
Of course.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.229
And our family.

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:04.360
And our good name.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.827
You have my word.

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:50.481
He'll be missed.

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:52.949
Not by me.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.621
Is it terrible to feel
nothing but relief?

00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:02.877
Nothing I ever did pleased him.

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:06.005
Not even your choice of wife?

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:09.758
He always said she would make
a fine mistress of Trenwith.

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:12.887
And I an indifferent master.

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:16.848
You can still prove him wrong.

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.975
Oh, now I've come
into my estate?

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:22.309
Half of it's mortgaged,
the other half soon will be.

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:29.028
But apparently now I'm one of
the most important men

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.483
in the county.

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:49.544
How is it you be
not at the burial?

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:52.176
It is for fancy folks
and family.

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:54.428
Not for the likes of me.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.510
Are you not family?

00:20:56.672 --> 00:21:00.051
Ross might say so, but...

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:03.562
I know it is not my place.

00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:05.348
What is your place?

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:07.608
Betwixt in between.

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.314
Neither one nor the other.

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:12.856
Need more flour,
stops it from sticking.

00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:15.320
See?

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.454
AUNT AGATHA: I warned Charles.

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:23.036
Too many capons and custards.

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:26.043
Look at me, poached egg,
a little broth,

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:29.081
fit as a fiddle.

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:33.839
Better than Francis,
by the look of it.

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.878
CARY: Grambler must
be taking its toll.

00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:39.265
GEORGE: Not to mention a young
morsel by the name of Margaret.

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:43.053
You dine there yourself lately?

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:46.974
My tastes are more
refined these days.

00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:51.773
Are you not coming down?

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:54.359
I really cannot face it.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:58.197
Nor I, but one of <i>us</i>
must play the hostess.

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:02.197
She didn't come.

00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:04.161
His wife.

00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:05.449
This isn't the occasion.

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:09.370
Will you give him
my good wishes?

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:13.132
Shouldn't you do that yourself?

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.667
I wouldn't know where to begin.

00:22:20.422 --> 00:22:21.799
FRANCIS: "Unwell"?

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:23.968
Not even the thought
of a téte-é-téte with Ross

00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:26.011
could persuade her? Francis...

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:27.680
She'll have few opportunities
with a Mistress Poldark

00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:30.396
to amuse him.

00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:32.026
You must be relieved.

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:33.481
HOW?

00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:35.444
You're not the only one
to disgrace the family

00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:37.023
by an unsuitable attachment.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.611
Francis!

00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:39.991
Consider yourself fortunate.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.242
See what you've missed.

00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:42.949
Dr. Choake.

00:22:43.112 --> 00:22:44.455
Hmm?

00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:46.490
Mm...

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.634
I've puzzled you out.

00:22:57.793 --> 00:22:59.010
Was I so hard to fathom?

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:03.219
Well, I thought so,
but your recent nuptials

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:05.350
have made everything clear.

00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:08.979
It delights you to thumb
your nose at society,

00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:11.766
because you consider yourself
above the niceties

00:23:11.932 --> 00:23:13.400
by which it operates.

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:15.152
Not above.

00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:17.780
Just indifferent.

00:23:28.532 --> 00:23:30.125
Are you pleased
with Wheal Leisure?

00:23:30.284 --> 00:23:32.582
Pray do not mention it to me.

00:23:32.745 --> 00:23:34.622
Mining's always a gamble.

00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:37.962
And the gamester rarely
meets a Good Samaritan.

00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:40.378
As in?

00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:44.549
Someone willing to take a
worthless bet off his hands.

00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:48.765
But should I hear of anyone,
would you be interested?

00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:32.389
<i>♪♪</i>

00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:06.635
What have I told you?

00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:10.176
I don't require my wife
to crochet and sip tea,

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:15.314
but I do require her to remember
she's not a beast of burden.

00:25:15.472 --> 00:25:17.019
Are you happy?

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:18.559
I am.

00:25:18.726 --> 00:25:20.444
Then I hope you'll be
even more so when I tell you

00:25:20.602 --> 00:25:22.195
who's coming to stay.

00:25:25.232 --> 00:25:26.575
Come on through.

00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:34.166
It's so kind of you
to invite me, my dear.

00:25:34.324 --> 00:25:36.247
Would you care
for some refreshment?

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.090
Oh, no, please,
let me take care of myself.

00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:40.373
The last thing I want
is to give you any trouble.

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:42.257
No trouble at all.

00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:44.589
We've been looking forward to
your visit, haven't we, Demelza?

00:25:44.752 --> 00:25:46.971
Yes, Ross.

00:25:49.423 --> 00:25:52.142
It's a quiet house
since Father died.

00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:54.770
Though Elizabeth plays the harp,

00:25:54.928 --> 00:25:57.351
and speaks French
to Geoffrey Charles,

00:25:57.514 --> 00:26:01.018
and I have my needlework,
Aunt Agatha her spinning.

00:26:01.185 --> 00:26:02.311
POLDARK: And Francis?

00:26:02.478 --> 00:26:04.276
<i>VERITY: Ls...</i>

00:26:04.438 --> 00:26:06.907
often away.

00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:12.950
This pie is delicious, my dear.

00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:14.456
Did you bake it yourself?

00:26:15.157 --> 00:26:16.249
Custard!

00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:18.331
I'll go and see if it's set.

00:26:21.121 --> 00:26:23.795
She thinks you a great lady,
you will show me what a mistake

00:26:23.957 --> 00:26:25.083
I've made of marrying her.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.877
Oh, what could I do?

00:26:27.044 --> 00:26:28.796
I'm sure you'll think
of something.

00:26:29.671 --> 00:26:31.298
Ross, no!

00:26:31.465 --> 00:26:32.591
Where are you going?

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:34.476
You cannot just... Ross!

00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:39.690
ZACKY: Blasted copper, it
is proving a devil to find.

00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:42.226
POLDARK: Blasting is the word.

00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:46.253
ZACKY:
It seems to be our only hope.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.318
(hammering metal)

00:26:58.408 --> 00:27:00.627
Right, boys.

00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:22.350
(bell dings)

00:27:24.852 --> 00:27:25.852
Some tea?

00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:29.068
Oh, thank you, but no.

00:27:29.231 --> 00:27:31.825
It's a little early.

00:27:31.984 --> 00:27:34.203
Oh.

00:27:34.361 --> 00:27:36.739
Yes, so it is.

00:27:36.905 --> 00:27:39.533
Thank you, Jinny.

00:27:53.046 --> 00:27:57.051
You know,
Ross is very dear to me.

00:27:57.217 --> 00:28:02.394
What woman should ever deserve
him, I couldn't imagine.

00:28:02.556 --> 00:28:05.355
So when I heard
he'd married you, I was...

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:07.519
Horrified. Relieved.

00:28:12.983 --> 00:28:15.111
Before he met you he was...

00:28:18.071 --> 00:28:19.368
broken.

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:21.875
Lost.

00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:26.084
So I was relieved to think he'd
found someone to console him,

00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:28.749
to save him from his loneliness.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.260
But now I see it's more
than consolation.

00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:38.301
You've given him hope.

00:28:38.467 --> 00:28:41.016
A life without hope is bleak.

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:43.938
And a life without love...

00:28:44.097 --> 00:28:45.189
Oh, it's not that.

00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:47.568
You do not? Love him?

00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:51.902
(sighs): Beyond anything.

00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:58.322
But I could never hope
that he... that he...

00:28:58.487 --> 00:29:01.491
That he would ever...

00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:04.956
He's kind to me.

00:29:05.118 --> 00:29:07.086
And when we're abed,

00:29:07.246 --> 00:29:10.420
I have reason to think
I do please him.

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.710
Oh, I'm sure you do.

00:29:14.378 --> 00:29:17.097
But I'd never call it love.

00:29:17.256 --> 00:29:22.308
He's never used that word to me,
and I misdoubt he ever shall.

00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:28.727
It's life's greatest treasure,
to love...

00:29:28.892 --> 00:29:31.020
(voice shaking):
And be loved in return.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:39.161
My dear, do you think I care
a jot where you come from

00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:43.699
or who your father is,
or how well you curtsy?

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.755
I often wished I could curtsy.

00:29:50.914 --> 00:29:52.006
Will you teach me, Verity?

00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:54.918
(loud explosion in the distance)

00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:58.096
(giggles)

00:29:58.255 --> 00:29:59.632
(giggling): To the left!

00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:00.890
Left, to the left!

00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:02.392
No, to the right a little.

00:30:02.551 --> 00:30:04.849
Well, make up your
blasted blathering minds!

00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:06.935
POLDARK: What in God's
name are you doing?

00:30:07.097 --> 00:30:08.817
We thought we should move it
into the parlor

00:30:08.974 --> 00:30:10.174
so Demelza may learn to dance.

00:30:11.518 --> 00:30:13.065
If you ladies
would give us leave?

00:30:13.228 --> 00:30:14.275
(giggling)

00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:23.989
Dip, one, two, three.

00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:27.535
Dip one, two, three.

00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:28.918
On your tip toes...

00:30:29.077 --> 00:30:31.921
One, two, three, dip.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.833
Dip.

00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:41.223
Foot behind, foot behind.

00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.600
One, two, three, step.

00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:45.352
Step...

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.932
Napkin...

00:30:47.095 --> 00:30:49.439
goes to the left of the plate.

00:30:50.599 --> 00:30:51.725
And slowly.

00:30:58.815 --> 00:31:00.738
Dip, one, two, three.

00:31:00.901 --> 00:31:02.027
(giggles)

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.946
Good.

00:31:07.491 --> 00:31:09.289
That man who used to meet
Verity here.

00:31:09.451 --> 00:31:10.543
Captain Blarney?

00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:12.579
Has nothing been heard of him?

00:31:12.746 --> 00:31:13.838
Thankfully, no.

00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:17.592
Oh Ross, the shame on you!

00:31:17.751 --> 00:31:18.877
What do you mean?

00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:20.842
How could you let them
part like that?

00:31:21.004 --> 00:31:22.301
What the devil could I do?

00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:24.307
You should've stood up
to your uncle for her.

00:31:24.466 --> 00:31:28.892
Even now in her heart
she still hankers for him.

00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:31.432
Then she must stop.

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.228
Why should she?

00:31:36.395 --> 00:31:39.615
Must hope be buried
and love denied?

00:31:39.773 --> 00:31:41.867
What do you know of love?

00:31:42.025 --> 00:31:44.574
A little.

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:45.862
Is that all?

00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:50.910
Then you must practice more.

00:32:19.813 --> 00:32:22.737
(baby cooing)

00:32:55.724 --> 00:32:57.476
DEMELZA:
Must you go home tomorrow?

00:32:57.642 --> 00:33:01.567
VERITY: Francis needs me,
but I'll come again soon.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.107
Did you really hate it today?

00:33:03.273 --> 00:33:04.820
Oh, no!

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:08.078
I'm just afeared we spent
too much money

00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:09.658
and it will all be wasted.

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.539
How could it?

00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:15.748
Only that perhaps my measuring
might not be the same for long.

00:33:18.163 --> 00:33:21.292
My dear, do you mean...

00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:22.755
Oh, Ross will be delighted!

00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:24.295
Don't tell him, not yet.

00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:26.964
See, he's not liked me for long.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.883
And when I get to waddling about
like an old duck,

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.142
he might forget
he ever liked me at all.

00:33:31.301 --> 00:33:32.848
Ross forgets nothing.

00:33:42.896 --> 00:33:47.652
If we're to find copper,
it is now or not at all.

00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:49.819
Come to watch us set
our final fuse?

00:33:49.986 --> 00:33:52.114
Will one more blast
get us through?

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.998
One more blast
is all we can afford.

00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:06.503
(bell chiming)

00:34:08.296 --> 00:34:11.596
(man shouting)

00:34:15.428 --> 00:34:18.398
(birds squawking)

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:38.376
I heard the bell, what's amiss?

00:34:38.535 --> 00:34:40.879
We must leave at once.

00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:43.540
Quickly!

00:34:43.707 --> 00:34:44.707
What is it?

00:34:44.791 --> 00:34:47.635
Nothing, sir... Ross.

00:34:47.794 --> 00:34:49.171
It's just...

00:34:49.337 --> 00:34:51.385
What's the matter?

00:34:51.548 --> 00:34:56.429
Sometimes... I do think
I displease you.

00:35:02.017 --> 00:35:03.985
I'm used to giving orders
and having no one

00:35:04.144 --> 00:35:07.148
to suit but myself, but you are
far from displeasing to me.

00:35:07.314 --> 00:35:09.658
See, how would I know that?

00:35:09.816 --> 00:35:11.989
I'll endeavor
to make it clearer.

00:35:12.152 --> 00:35:13.779
We must go.

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:16.039
Make haste.

00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:19.625
Where are we going?

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.585
(men shouting)

00:35:46.936 --> 00:35:51.817
(happy, indistinct chatter)

00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:26.769
(excited commotion)

00:36:38.321 --> 00:36:39.521
POLDARK: Good catch, eh, Mark?

00:36:39.572 --> 00:36:41.370
MARK: Handsome, Ross.

00:36:41.533 --> 00:36:44.082
More than a quarter million,
they reckon before they're done.

00:36:44.244 --> 00:36:47.123
I'm very glad; It'll make
the difference this winter.

00:36:47.288 --> 00:36:48.790
It will indeed!

00:36:48.957 --> 00:36:50.584
Night, Ross, night, ma'am.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:51.842
Night, Mark.

00:36:52.001 --> 00:36:54.379
Night, Ross, night, ma'am.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:03.062
Night, Ross, night, ma'am.

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:04.347
Good night.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.568
Everyone's happy tonight.

00:37:10.687 --> 00:37:11.779
They like you.

00:37:11.938 --> 00:37:13.531
Nonsense.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:17.194
'Tis the truth, I should know,
I'm one of them.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.285
You're a gent,
you don't despise them.

00:37:21.448 --> 00:37:24.497
You help them, give them food,
and, work, and...

00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:26.286
Marry you?

00:37:26.453 --> 00:37:28.046
No, not that.

00:37:28.204 --> 00:37:30.423
They don't know
what to make of that.

00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:32.960
But they like you just the same.

00:37:43.553 --> 00:37:45.976
And you?

00:37:46.139 --> 00:37:49.109
Do you like me?

00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:52.521
I could learn to!

00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:54.485
And I, you.

00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:58.235
(wind howling)

00:38:24.844 --> 00:38:26.721
We're still not through.

00:38:26.888 --> 00:38:28.515
I could swear
we're almost there.

00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:30.854
But we're out of gunpowder.

00:38:31.017 --> 00:38:32.769
And capital.

00:38:32.936 --> 00:38:34.028
And investors.

00:38:34.187 --> 00:38:35.780
How long can we continue?

00:38:35.939 --> 00:38:38.408
An optimist would say
three months.

00:38:38.566 --> 00:38:40.489
And a realist?

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:41.778
Two.

00:38:41.945 --> 00:38:44.323
I must find more investment.

00:38:52.372 --> 00:38:55.421
It gives me no pleasure
to tell you this,

00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:57.335
but capital's short.

00:38:57.502 --> 00:38:58.879
I understand.

00:38:59.045 --> 00:39:00.547
Though I've kept my ear
to the ground

00:39:00.713 --> 00:39:03.057
in case other speculators
could be found.

00:39:03.216 --> 00:39:04.308
And?

00:39:04.467 --> 00:39:07.437
Tom Choake has done you
no favors, Ross.

00:39:07.595 --> 00:39:10.223
His views on your marriage.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:12.643
"Ross Poldark, the loose cannon.

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:15.779
Too much of a risk
for the prudent investor."

00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:26.364
I blame myself.

00:39:26.531 --> 00:39:28.249
You couldn't foresee
as we'd hit such rock.

00:39:28.408 --> 00:39:31.207
But I could foresee that
in marrying my kitchen maid,

00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:33.417
I'd scandalize all I might
look to for capital.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.426
Well, short of jilting her
and wedding a rich heiress.

00:39:37.584 --> 00:39:40.258
Perhaps I was over-hasty.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.639
But it's done now.

00:39:42.797 --> 00:39:45.220
So how shall we order things?

00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:47.063
We can last till the week
before Christmas.

00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:48.478
(sighs)

00:39:48.636 --> 00:39:50.229
Let it be the week after.

00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:51.890
If I have to sell half my house,

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:54.150
I'll not ruin Christmas
for them.

00:39:57.145 --> 00:39:59.113
(sighs)

00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:11.619
(Jud drunkenly singing)

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:25.090
(all singing)

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:43.825
(door opens and closes)

00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:46.695
From Francis.

00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:50.491
Inviting us to spend
Christmas at Trenwith.

00:40:51.908 --> 00:40:53.034
Oh.

00:40:54.619 --> 00:40:56.621
What's the matter?

00:40:56.788 --> 00:40:58.836
I... I couldn't.

00:40:58.998 --> 00:41:02.423
You go...

00:41:02.585 --> 00:41:04.553
Naturally we both go
or we both stay.

00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:07.010
Ross, I aren't their sort.

00:41:07.173 --> 00:41:09.050
They'll look down their noses,
they'll send me to eat

00:41:09.217 --> 00:41:10.469
with the servants.

00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:13.184
Do you think I ought to be
ashamed of you'?

00:41:13.346 --> 00:41:15.098
<i>"Us not that, but"...</i>

00:41:15.264 --> 00:41:17.483
You think they are
so much better than you?

00:41:17.642 --> 00:41:21.522
I don't, but they'll think so.

00:41:21.688 --> 00:41:25.613
Maybe not Verity, but...

00:41:25.775 --> 00:41:27.869
Elizabeth.

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.540
You do her an injustice.

00:41:32.699 --> 00:41:34.372
And me.

00:41:34.534 --> 00:41:36.332
You?

00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:39.623
To think I could admire someone
who thought meanly of you.

00:41:39.789 --> 00:41:42.383
Do you admire her?

00:41:42.542 --> 00:41:45.887
Elizabeth was born
to be admired.

00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:47.297
And I was born to pull turnips.

00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:48.885
(chuckles)

00:41:51.426 --> 00:41:52.518
What are you doing?

00:41:52.677 --> 00:41:54.930
Accepting the invitation.

00:42:03.396 --> 00:42:07.026
(hammering)

00:42:16.617 --> 00:42:18.790
What a sorry Christmas
I've handed them.

00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:20.796
No.

00:42:20.955 --> 00:42:23.049
You've handed them
near on a 12 month of work

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:24.880
they'd otherwise not have.

00:42:51.527 --> 00:42:53.200
Welcome.

00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:43.291
My dear, it's so good of you
to come to us.

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:45.957
May I take you
to meet Aunt Agatha?

00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:54.261
Married, you say?

00:43:54.423 --> 00:43:55.549
To my nephew?

00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:56.933
Why wasn't I told of this?

00:43:57.093 --> 00:43:58.436
FRANCIS: You were, Aunt.

00:43:58.594 --> 00:44:00.141
I told you myself!

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:01.647
They never tell me anything.

00:44:01.806 --> 00:44:05.185
And you, bud,
where are you from?

00:44:05.351 --> 00:44:08.446
Llluggan, ma'am.

00:44:08.604 --> 00:44:12.029
Who do we know from llluggan?

00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:15.070
The Cardews?

00:44:15.236 --> 00:44:16.829
You'll know Sir John, of course.

00:44:16.988 --> 00:44:20.037
And the Perrins of Helston Hall?

00:44:20.199 --> 00:44:22.952
No, no, ma'am.

00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:28.876
Six generations
of Poldarks I have seen.

00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:31.009
Now what do you think of that?

00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:33.592
You think I don't look
old enough?

00:44:33.754 --> 00:44:35.222
Quite right, too.

00:44:35.381 --> 00:44:38.931
Now go and sit by Elizabeth
so that I can see

00:44:39.093 --> 00:44:40.845
how you measure up.

00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:41.854
Aunt Agatha!

00:44:42.013 --> 00:44:43.640
Go on, child.

00:44:43.806 --> 00:44:45.058
Go, off you go!

00:44:53.733 --> 00:44:54.905
Hm...

00:44:55.067 --> 00:44:57.115
A pretty little thing.

00:44:58.988 --> 00:45:01.207
A mite coarse beside Elizabeth,

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:03.788
but doubtless she'll
polish up sufficient

00:45:03.951 --> 00:45:06.545
when the need arises.

00:45:11.209 --> 00:45:14.133
<i>DEMELZA:
I thought she'd hate me.</i>

00:45:14.295 --> 00:45:17.139
I don't blame her, I mean I
probably should in her shoes.

00:45:17.298 --> 00:45:19.892
Then you have less sense
than I credit to her.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:27.560
FRANCIS: You think I don't
know what you're about?

00:45:30.019 --> 00:45:31.441
Taking her under your wing?

00:45:31.604 --> 00:45:33.277
Making her your friend?
Francis...

00:45:33.439 --> 00:45:37.489
"Oh Ross, see how kind
and generous I am!"

00:45:37.652 --> 00:45:40.326
"Look what a pearl you've lost!"

00:45:40.488 --> 00:45:41.580
You're being ridiculous.

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:43.912
Am I?

00:45:56.462 --> 00:45:58.055
(knock at door)

00:46:07.306 --> 00:46:08.398
What's this?

00:46:08.557 --> 00:46:10.184
Just something
I ordered from town.

00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:11.819
No, Ross!

00:46:11.978 --> 00:46:13.446
It's meant <i>as</i> a surprise!

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:16.198
It's just a family party.

00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:18.906
No need to flig
yourself up for it.

00:46:19.068 --> 00:46:20.786
I asked Verity
and she said it was right

00:46:20.945 --> 00:46:23.414
to change for Christmas Eve.

00:46:23.572 --> 00:46:25.052
Well, don't lace
your stays too tight.

00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:28.916
They feed you well here
and I know your appetite.

00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:46.851
You were very kind to Demelza.

00:46:47.013 --> 00:46:48.230
Who wouldn't be?

00:46:48.389 --> 00:46:50.266
She looks like a startled faun.

00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:51.685
She's young.

00:46:51.851 --> 00:46:54.445
And this must seem
very daunting to her.

00:47:02.445 --> 00:47:06.325
You don't despise
my choice then.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:10.620
What right have I
to despise anyone?

00:47:10.786 --> 00:47:15.257
Besides I've too much
to distract me here...

00:47:15.416 --> 00:47:19.887
Grambler failing and Francis
gambling away his inheritance.

00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:22.973
I'm sad to hear it.

00:47:23.132 --> 00:47:25.931
Oh, and worse!

00:47:26.093 --> 00:47:27.265
Rumors...

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:34.277
No, reports,
that he has another woman.

00:47:39.231 --> 00:47:41.029
<i>Has he'?</i>

00:47:41.192 --> 00:47:43.991
If he has, he's an idiot.

00:47:44.153 --> 00:47:47.703
(footsteps approaching)

00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:49.742
I am ravenous!

00:47:49.909 --> 00:47:51.877
When do we dine?

00:47:52.036 --> 00:47:53.288
DEMELZA: I can scarce stand up.

00:47:53.454 --> 00:47:56.924
Lord knows how
I'll keep my food down.

00:47:57.083 --> 00:48:00.713
And they'll think
I'm that vulgar and simple.

00:48:02.505 --> 00:48:05.099
Ross will be sorry
he ever wed me.

00:48:05.257 --> 00:48:06.679
Here, let me help you.

00:48:06.842 --> 00:48:08.469
I shan't lace you too tightly.

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:14.858
Thank you.

00:48:15.017 --> 00:48:17.270
Trust your husband.

00:48:17.436 --> 00:48:18.904
And yourself.

00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.654
(knock at door in the distance)

00:48:22.817 --> 00:48:24.160
Visitors?

00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:25.695
At this hour?

00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:32.542
We were just passing, Francis.

00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:36.547
Thought we'd come and offer
the compliments of the season.

00:48:36.705 --> 00:48:39.549
If we're intruding,
we can easily depart.

00:48:39.708 --> 00:48:40.800
Damn me nostrils, though!

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.303
What do I scent?

00:48:42.461 --> 00:48:43.553
Swan?

00:48:43.712 --> 00:48:45.430
Partridge?

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:47.683
Mrs. Tabb, please lay
four more places for dinner.

00:48:47.842 --> 00:48:49.219
TRENEGLOS: Ross Poldark

00:48:49.385 --> 00:48:50.682
the famed recluse!

00:48:50.845 --> 00:48:54.975
For all we see of you,
you might be Robinson Crusoe!

00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:57.109
Oh, but he has his
Man Friday, dear.

00:48:57.268 --> 00:48:59.896
Is she hereabout?

00:49:00.062 --> 00:49:02.030
(quietly): Or should we
seek her in the scullery?

00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:03.406
(scoffs)

00:49:05.401 --> 00:49:07.369
RUTH:
An attempt on the king's life?

00:49:07.528 --> 00:49:09.328
TRENEGLOS: Ambush for his
west good, no doubt.

00:49:09.488 --> 00:49:12.287
I'm told it's worth more than
half the mines in Cornwall.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:15.294
And the royal household servants
not paid for 12 months.

00:49:15.453 --> 00:49:16.813
CARY:
I'm amazed no one's attempted

00:49:16.954 --> 00:49:19.082
to sharpen a knife
on the king of France.

00:49:19.248 --> 00:49:21.376
Well, give them time, sir,
give them time.

00:49:21.542 --> 00:49:22.885
Dinner is served.

00:49:23.043 --> 00:49:24.420
TRENEGLOS: Excellent.

00:49:24.587 --> 00:49:26.089
(exhales)

00:49:26.255 --> 00:49:28.633
(footsteps approaching)

00:49:56.327 --> 00:49:57.453
Demelza...

00:50:04.376 --> 00:50:06.344
Let me introduce you.

00:50:08.422 --> 00:50:12.052
(indistinct chatter)

00:50:12.218 --> 00:50:14.266
TRENEGLOS: Damn you, Ross, for
keeping this rosebud a secret!

00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:16.430
RUTH: Hardly secret, John.

00:50:16.597 --> 00:50:19.897
All the county was talking
of her in June.

00:50:20.059 --> 00:50:22.312
Oh yes, ma'am, people dearly
love to gossip, don't they?

00:50:22.478 --> 00:50:23.570
Ha!

00:50:23.729 --> 00:50:25.356
Well answered, Mistress!

00:50:25.523 --> 00:50:29.073
A merry Christmas
and damnation to all gossip!

00:50:29.235 --> 00:50:31.454
VERITY (quietly):
She's on her mettle tonight.

00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:33.159
POLDARK (quietly):
Overdoing the manners a bit.

00:50:33.322 --> 00:50:34.414
Look at her plate.

00:50:34.573 --> 00:50:35.995
She's hardly touched a morsel.

00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:38.126
Too busy making conquests!

00:50:38.285 --> 00:50:39.207
CARY:
What news of the mine, Ross?

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:41.372
Are we swimming in copper yet?

00:50:41.539 --> 00:50:43.086
Not according to my father.

00:50:43.249 --> 00:50:45.297
We have reason for optimism.

00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:47.006
FRANCIS: Glad to hear it, Ross.

00:50:47.169 --> 00:50:48.967
At least one of us
is prospering.

00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:54.643
CARY (quietly): You believe him?

00:50:54.802 --> 00:50:56.145
(whispering): Each way, we win.

00:50:56.303 --> 00:50:59.933
Enjoy his ruin
or the fruits of his labor.

00:51:00.099 --> 00:51:04.650
Our friend Choake
saw the wisdom of my offer

00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:06.860
and sold me his shares
in Wheal Leisure.

00:51:07.022 --> 00:51:11.072
(laughs)

00:51:11.235 --> 00:51:13.954
(Demelza and John laughing)

00:51:14.113 --> 00:51:15.990
How do you manage
for servants, Elizabeth?

00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:19.660
Mama and I were only saying,
young girls these days

00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:23.832
have such ideas always trying
to rise above their station.

00:51:23.998 --> 00:51:26.126
ELIZABETH:
I haven't noticed that.

00:51:26.292 --> 00:51:28.340
Perhaps you've been unlucky.

00:51:28.502 --> 00:51:32.507
Well, at least I have
my own household.

00:51:32.673 --> 00:51:35.017
My poor sisters
all lack husbands.

00:51:35.175 --> 00:51:39.146
And truly, beyond the age
of 23, what hope is there?

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:43.890
I don't believe there's
ever cause to give up hope.

00:51:46.145 --> 00:51:48.318
'Tis sometimes
a question of waiting.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.199
RUTH: And seizing the
opportunity when it comes.

00:51:51.358 --> 00:51:54.532
I bow before your expertise,
ma'am.

00:51:57.031 --> 00:52:00.661

(applause)

00:55:17.481 --> 00:55:18.573
FRANCIS: Good night.

00:55:18.732 --> 00:55:20.405
(door closes)

00:55:20.567 --> 00:55:22.945
(sighs)

00:55:26.532 --> 00:55:28.910
It's a curious thing.

00:55:34.748 --> 00:55:37.092
(sighs)

00:55:37.251 --> 00:55:40.926
We envy a man
for something he has

00:55:41.088 --> 00:55:45.343
yet the truth may be
he hasn't got it after all.

00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:48.433
And we have.

00:55:54.142 --> 00:55:55.985
Am I rambling?

00:55:56.144 --> 00:55:58.522
Ignore me.

00:56:03.318 --> 00:56:06.618
Merry Christmas, cousin.

00:56:09.241 --> 00:56:10.493
Merry Christmas.

00:56:19.251 --> 00:56:21.128
Merry Christmas, my love.

00:56:47.195 --> 00:56:48.287
Thank you, Francis.

00:56:48.447 --> 00:56:50.199
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

00:56:58.957 --> 00:57:01.085
That wasn't so bad.

00:57:21.813 --> 00:57:25.192
POLDARK: I hope you won't live to
regret your choice of husband.

00:57:25.359 --> 00:57:26.451
Why would I?

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:30.205
We may soon be destitute.

00:57:30.364 --> 00:57:33.584
There are other kinds
of treasure.

00:57:33.742 --> 00:57:36.495
(bell ringing)

00:57:36.662 --> 00:57:38.164
What is it?

00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:39.547
A rockfall?

00:57:45.212 --> 00:57:46.555
(men shouting)

00:57:46.713 --> 00:57:47.805
What's happened?

00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:49.057
Copper!

00:57:49.216 --> 00:57:50.308
Copper's been struck!

00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:53.471
A monstrous load!

00:57:53.637 --> 00:57:57.267
(laughing)

00:58:14.741 --> 00:58:16.493
So how did I do, Ross?

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:19.209
You were not too ashamed of me?

00:58:24.126 --> 00:58:25.503
Why do you think I married you'?

00:58:27.421 --> 00:58:29.094
I don't rightly know.

00:58:31.133 --> 00:58:35.013
To satisfy an appetite?

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:36.646
To save myself from being alone?

00:58:40.058 --> 00:58:42.436
Because it was
the right thing to do?

00:58:43.562 --> 00:58:46.111
I had few expectations.

00:58:46.273 --> 00:58:49.903
At best, you'd be a distraction.

00:58:50.068 --> 00:58:52.446
A bandage to ease a wound.

00:58:54.865 --> 00:58:57.914
But I was mistaken.

00:58:59.661 --> 00:59:02.540
You have redeemed me.

00:59:02.706 --> 00:59:05.755
I am your humble servant.

00:59:05.917 --> 00:59:08.921
And I love you.

00:59:23.143 --> 00:59:25.487
I hope you will have
a little love to spare.

00:59:28.356 --> 00:59:30.154
For what?

00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:33.612
Our child.
