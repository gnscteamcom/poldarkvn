WEBVTT

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.505


00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:38.037
Thank you.

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.887
And one more thing,
Mr. Tresidder.

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:54.391
Your mill provides rolling
and cutting services

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.176
for the Carnmore Copper Company?

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:57.560
Yes.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.316
In these difficult times,
we urge all who bank with us

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:06.149
to consider where their
best interests lie.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.313
Particularly when they have

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.233
several outstanding
loans with us.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:24.296
Still building
your empire, Ross?

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:25.654
And you bought all the copper.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.212
All we could afford
while the price was low.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.845
Next time, they'll be wise to us
and the price will rise.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:35.348
That is good news for the mines
and your shareholders.

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:36.975
In the short term, yes.

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.431
And in the long term,

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:41.221
anything which breaks
the Warleggans' stranglehold

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:45.518
and stops them keeping prices
artificially low...

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:47.982
Benefits Leisure and Carnmore.

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.398
Benefits miners, smelters,
and shareholders alike.

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:54.285
The Warleggans only seem
to benefit themselves, Francis.

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.580
I hope you know
what you're taking on.

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.616
I would I had your support.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.335
I know I have your discretion.

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:07.339
Of course.

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.030
I've been too busy to bake.

00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:37.786
How's that?

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.036
I told you.

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.665
I've been helping Dr. Enys
with his work.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:45.248
Enys ain't your husband.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.504
But people hereabout
depend on him.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.920
I'm proud to serve him.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.469
Damp and dust,
no friend to the lungs.

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.263
Fresh air and exercise.

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:05.772
A little sea bathing.

00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:08.935
Fennel root and ginger
in warm water.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.443
Come and see me in a month.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:17.575
Trencrom's finest!

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.782
Need you inform
half of Cornwall?

00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:23.074
Tucked her away, I did,
in your father's old mine!

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.913
Wheal Grace?

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.998
Best hiding place there be.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.504
Take a brave man
to venture down there.

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.006
Folk say it's haunted.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.256
You'll be haunted

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.541
if that barrel's not intact
when I return home.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:34.755
Aye, sir.

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:37.171
You know me, sir...
Honest <i>as</i> the day is short.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.598
Trencrom?

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.601
Suppliers of fine goods,
direct from France.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.013
Without troubling the excisemen?

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.267
Will you break even this month?

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.026
With luck.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.357
And a fair auction.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.772
You must be relieved.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:56.864
Yes.

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.199
I should get back
to my patients.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.407
Dwight...

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:09.119
(softly): Have a care.

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.458
Of course.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.592
You look weary, Mark.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.842
<i>Keven.</i>

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:19.676
She do have me up all hours,
mending the roof.

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.637
Mind you don't exhaust yourself.

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.393
MARK: 'Tisn't I who
wants minding, Ross.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.151
<i>Ross,</i> I bring word
from Tresidder's Mill.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.527
As of next week,

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:36.780
we must look elsewhere
for our rolling and cutting.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:39.775
So be it.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.194
We shall take our
business elsewhere.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.178
Shall we walk to Prudie?

00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:07.432
Come on, ready?

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:27.337
That be Master Ross's rum.

00:07:27.376 --> 00:07:28.248
'Twas.

00:07:28.653 --> 00:07:30.055
<i>Now it be Master duds.</i>

00:07:30.058 --> 00:07:30.150

I'm away.

Cap'n Poldark'll fetch ye

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.506
Cap'n Poldark.

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.925
Who be Cap'n Poldark
giving himself airs?

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:55.596
Everyone do know he's had half
the maids from here to Truro!

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.764
Keep your voice down

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.183
The child? That child?

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:02.023
What about Jinny Carter's child?

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:03.687
What about it?

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.733
Everybody do know that

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:07.898
'Tis a lie!

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:08.982
Ignore him.

'Tis a wicked, wicked lie!

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:14.873
No wonder he went to Bodmin
to see Jim Carter in the ground!

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:16.954
And don't ye bend ye brows

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.585
at me, girl.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.166
He ain't naught but a trull
from 'Luggan!

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:24.748
Go.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:25.963
Go where?

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.128
I neither know nor care.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.342
But if you're still
in this house by daybreak,

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.475
I will personally horsewhip you
from here to Truro!

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:50.324
Where's Verity?

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.076
Is she not in her room?

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.584
If Jud goes, so will Prudie.

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:06.124
And I'm sorry for that.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.009
For you'll miss her.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:11.047
But what he said,
I cannot think he meant it.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.135
You know how he is
when the liquor's upon him.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.517
<i>My</i> liquor was upon him!

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.098
He's lucky it wasn't my foot!

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:20.389
Liquor or not,

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:23.434
he's disrespected you
and this house once too often.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:28.651
Best place I ever know'd.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.565
And now, thanks to thee...

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:33.485
'Tisn't right, 'tisn't fair,
'tisn't just, 'tisn't fitting.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:36.530
Hold your clack, you black worm,
or I'll crown thee meself!

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.465
Where's Verity?

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.343
Little Verity?

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:52.424
Out, I believe.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.848
Did she say where?

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:58.684
Not as I recall.

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:04.145
Left something, though.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.936
What?

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.237
Sealed, it was.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.743
As if I care
to know her secrets.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.784
"I've known and loved you
all my life, dear Francis,

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.257
"so I pray you will understand
the grief and loss I feel

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.507
that this should be
our parting."

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.909
You will lie here tonight,
my dear.

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:59.070
I've arranged to sleep
on board my ship.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.456
And tomorrow...

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:05.414
We shall be wed.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:08.955
So this is how she cares for us?

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.749
To sneak away
under our very noses

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.418
and marry that
wife-murdering drunkard?

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:15.006
But how was it arranged?

00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:16.796
She must have had help.

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:21.051
Has anyone been calling
unbeknown to us?

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.015
Or been seen about the grounds?

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:26.147
Someone that knew Miss Verity

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:27.979
and might have
carried a message?

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.728
I knew this was Ross's doing!

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:32.986
Why would you think that?

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.365
Because he has
helped them before!

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:36.523
I can see it all.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.696
He's encouraged Verity...

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:38.906
We do not know this.

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:40.570
He's been acting
<i>as</i> agent to Blarney,

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:41.909
keeping the skunk's
interest warm,

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:45.245
and using Demelza
as a go-between.

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:46.660
You're too hasty.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.169
We've no proof Demelza's
involved, let alone Ross.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:51.582
Oh, yes, of course, you will
always stand up for Ross!

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.625
I stand up for no one.

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:56.670
But it is the merest justice
not to condemn people unheard.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:14:00.807
There is no other way
this could have been managed.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.388
She has no post,
I have seen to that.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.643
Damn Ross!

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:07.806
Damn this family,

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:12.227
damn this entire pitiful excuse
for an existence!

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:25.703
I hope I'm not intruding.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.414
But I see that I am.

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.453
Is something amiss?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.877
Forgive me,

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.168
but it may be within my power
to offer assistance.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:38.428
I suspect not.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:41.009
But that is precisely
the reason I'm here.

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:56.862
So there you have
our predicament.

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:59.194
That's extraordinary.

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.200
What I despise most
is the deceit.

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:03.987
And from someone I trusted.

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:05.325
Your sister?

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:06.488
My cousin.

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:08.370
You blame Ross?

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:10.667
Entirely.

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:14.001
You mentioned a reason
for your visit?

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:15.756
FRANCIS: No doubt I've...

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.713
omitted some payment.

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:20.879
GEORGE: On the contrary.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:24.800
We, our family, find ourselves
indebted to you.

00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:27.643
HOW?

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:32.686
You're aware that substantial
gaming losses

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.609
were accrued by Francis
to my cousin Matthew?

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.780
It's possible...

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.566
<i>Probable...</i>

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:46.613
That you were a victim
of Matthew's dishonesty.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.874
That being so,
we wish to make amends.

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.126
HOW?

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.037
By canceling some of your debts
to our bank.

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:56.547
We cannot accept charity,
George.

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.379
Charity be damned.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:15:59.918
Our family's integrity
has been compromised

00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:02.428
and we wish to recover it.

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:05.466
I insist you accept our apology.

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.259
And £1,200.

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:11.145
12?!

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.034
And now we need detain you
no longer.

00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:29.497
Do not keep Francis up too late.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.015
I have his best interests
at heart.

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.494
You see?

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.254
I did mend your smile,
after all.

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:50.017
Aniseed...

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:52.349
Hartshorn...

00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:55.393
Senna...

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:58.518
Aqua Mirabilis.

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:01.479
What are they for?

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:05.446
I've a thirst for learning.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:13.825
Some are nature's remedies,
others I concoct myself.

00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:17.211
All are <i>as</i> efficacious as any
Thomas Choake prescribes,

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:21.375
but infinitely more affordable.

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:23.589
You'll not make a living
like that.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:27.885
I came here to heal my patients,
not bankrupt them.

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:29.845
You've already made me
whole again.

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.771
This must stop, Keren,
this coming here.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.130
Your husband does not like it.

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.603
Do you like it?

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:42.733
I have work to do.

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:43.987
My purpose here is...

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:45.146
Kiss me.

00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:46.031
No.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.783
Just the once.

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:51.617
Keren, you and I know
it would not be just the once.

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:54.164
Would that matter?

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.953
What matters is...
where it would lead.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.712
Shall I go on?

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:13.301
And on?

00:18:13.467 --> 00:18:16.016
Till you tell me to stop?

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:55.559
'Tisn't just Jud.

00:18:56.677 --> 00:18:58.429
'Tis Carnmore do trouble you.

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:04.360
There are forces opposing us.

00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:06.441
Warleggan forces?

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:08.982
With what aim?

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:12.197
To put us out of business.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.237
Well, if Tresidder won't have
you, where will you go?

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:16.576
We'll find somewhere.

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:19.333
The whole of Cornwall
doesn't yet knuckle to George.

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:20.994
Nor will it, if I can help it.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.254
What could George do?

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:25.540
For now, nothing.

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:27.879
He's leaned on Tresidder,

00:19:28.042 --> 00:19:29.760
but unless he discovers
these names...

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.171
If he did?

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:35.183
He'd realize that,
barring myself and Henshawe,

00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:37.514
all bank at Warleggans'.

00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:43.895
What are you doing?

00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:46.231
Hiding it.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.262
'Twas a rockfall.

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:22.646
The charge was damp.

00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:24.273
We thought it dead,
and then out of nowhere...

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:25.979
Are you badly hurt?

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:27.735
Get Dr. Enys to look at that.

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:29.520
I'd sooner bleed to death!

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:37.202
It's galling for the family,

00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:38.921
but your sister
will realize her mistake

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.823
and soon come crying home.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.287
Well, then let Ross take her in,

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.770
since he encouraged
her treachery.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:48.838
Damn it, I expect more loyalty
from my only cousin.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.467
What did lever do

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.377
that he should go
behind my back like this?

00:20:53.544 --> 00:20:54.841
Well...

00:20:55.004 --> 00:20:57.757
I suppose you married
the girl he loved, didn't you?

00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:02.178
Yes.

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:04.017
Yes, that.

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.775
No, that was long ago, and he's
happily married himself now.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.522
More happily, in fact, than...

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:18.532
No, it's not on that score,
I assure you.

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:33.501
(shouting): Keren?

00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:39.924
<i>Keven'?</i>

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.703
I sympathize.

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:06.201
I, too, find Ross unfathomable.

00:22:08.369 --> 00:22:12.169
In some ways, you and I
are in the same boat.

00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:34.270
What's perplexed me of late has
been Ross's attitude towards me.

00:22:34.436 --> 00:22:36.564
When he opened his mine,

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.949
the other venturers were
for banking with Warleggans',

00:22:39.108 --> 00:22:41.827
yet he fought tooth and nail
to go with Pascoe's.

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:45.160
No, I doubt that was personal.

00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:47.165
And then this wildcat
copper-smelting scheme.

00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:49.702
It's clearly directed
against us.

00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.837
I don't think against you,
precisely.

00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:53.464
The aim is to get

00:22:53.622 --> 00:22:55.670
fairer prices for the mines.

00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:57.426
It's not the scheme
which upsets me,

00:22:57.585 --> 00:23:00.338
for it will fail
for lack of money.

00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:04.509
But it demonstrates
an enmity towards me

00:23:04.675 --> 00:23:06.769
which I don't feel I deserve.

00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:14.398
Any more than you deserve
his betrayal.

00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:19.695
Of your family.

00:23:28.866 --> 00:23:30.493
Where have you been?

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:32.252
Oh, Mark!

00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:33.412
You're back early.

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:34.705
Why did you...?

00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:36.294
You're hurt!

00:23:36.457 --> 00:23:37.174
What happened?

00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:38.004
Let me see.

00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:39.384
Where have you been?

00:23:39.543 --> 00:23:41.170
I couldn't sleep, I had a pain.

00:23:41.337 --> 00:23:42.777
I thought maybe a walk
would ease it.

00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:44.511
You've been with Enys.

00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:46.175
I've not!

00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:48.720
You've been lying with Enys.

00:23:48.886 --> 00:23:49.887
I went to see him.

00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:51.055
He's a doctor, isn't he?

00:23:51.221 --> 00:23:52.501
I needed something for the pain.

00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:54.225
How long?

00:23:54.391 --> 00:23:55.062
What?

00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:56.226
How long were you there?

00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:57.440
About an hour.

00:23:57.603 --> 00:24:00.072
I waited three.

00:24:03.984 --> 00:24:06.112
'Twas nothing, Mark.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.954
'Twas only a kiss.

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.993
'Twas only the once.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.959
It was him, he...
he pestered me,

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:19.842
he wouldn't let me be.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.126
'Tis you that's to blame.

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:24.297
You left me alone overmuch.

00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:25.715
You never loved me enough!

00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:27.633
I loved ye more than life!

00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:29.801
I did.

00:24:29.927 --> 00:24:30.928
I loved ye, Keren.

00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:32.438
You don't know what love is!

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:34.598
You don't know!

00:24:34.765 --> 00:24:35.765
No...

00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:38.778
You don't know, you don't know!

00:24:38.936 --> 00:24:41.030
You don't know! You don't know!

00:24:41.188 --> 00:24:43.361
You don't know!

00:25:07.297 --> 00:25:09.015
<i>Keven'?</i>

00:25:11.844 --> 00:25:13.391
Keren...

00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:22.692
Don't ye fool with me, Keren.

00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:24.072
Wake up now.

00:25:32.072 --> 00:25:33.574
Wake up, Keren.

00:25:35.617 --> 00:25:36.709
Wake up!

00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:52.225
No...

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:55.892
Oh, no.

00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:58.808
Oh, no, Keren!

00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:00.066
I never meant...

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:01.317
“In-

00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:03.820
I never meant...

00:26:10.944 --> 00:26:12.036
Damn Ross!

00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:18.036
Damn his scheming!

00:26:18.202 --> 00:26:20.921
He has married my sister
to a wife-beater

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.630
and he has disgraced
my family name.

00:26:24.792 --> 00:26:27.511
You know, if he cares
so little for my interest,

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:29.216
why should I care for his?

00:26:33.675 --> 00:26:36.895
You were saying you thought
Carnmore was well supported.

00:26:38.639 --> 00:26:42.519
Surely no man of sense
would invest in such a scheme.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.034
What would you say
to Lord Devoran?

00:26:52.903 --> 00:26:54.405
Or Sir John Trevaunance?

00:26:56.824 --> 00:26:58.792
Or Richard Ton kin?

00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:01.045
Henry Blewiit?

00:27:01.203 --> 00:27:02.955
Thomas Johnson?

00:27:03.122 --> 00:27:04.669
William Aukitt?

00:27:50.711 --> 00:27:54.136
JUD: What I said, 'twas
nothing worse than usual.

00:27:56.216 --> 00:27:57.468
<i>"Us he."</i>

00:27:57.634 --> 00:28:01.184
Getting soft
since he did wed her.

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:04.316
And since
the blatherin' child come.

00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:09.191
And there be another.

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:10.571
Cakey as custard.

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:40.719
Mr. Daniel?

00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:42.763
I regret this intrusion, but...

00:28:47.517 --> 00:28:48.597
I believe I've wronged you.

00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:50.403
I have no excuse, but I was...

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.278
I wish to make amends.

00:29:05.369 --> 00:29:06.996
Oh, God, no!

00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:12.176
We had it from surgeon hisself.

00:29:12.334 --> 00:29:13.551
'Twas maybe an accident.

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:18.306
Where's Mark?

00:29:18.465 --> 00:29:20.305
Haven't seen him
since he went home last night.

00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:21.343
<i>"Us never Mark's doing."</i>

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.762
He did love her.

00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:24.180
Little as she deserve it.

00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:26.144
I must speak with him, Paul.

00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:28.183
Your brother's
in serious trouble.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.476
If you know where he is...

00:29:29.643 --> 00:29:31.065
How would I?

00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:35.240
Surgeon needs
to watch his back, though.

00:29:35.399 --> 00:29:36.901
He's no more than a boy.

00:29:37.067 --> 00:29:38.569
Mark could snap him
easy as a twig.

00:29:38.735 --> 00:29:39.577
And Keren?

00:29:39.736 --> 00:29:41.738
We all know his strength.

00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:44.408
We know he wouldn't mean
to hurt her.

00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:46.576
You'd never turn him in!

00:29:46.743 --> 00:29:48.461
I've known him since
I was a boy.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.921
I've no wish to see him hunted
down and hung from a gibbet.

00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:54.300
But if he's done this thing...

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:55.551
He'll get no justice!

00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:57.463
You know that!

00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:59.381
Just ask Jim Carter.

00:30:13.103 --> 00:30:15.231
ROSS: How did she die?

00:30:15.397 --> 00:30:16.990
Broken neck.

00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:18.617
Deliberate?

00:30:20.193 --> 00:30:22.571
I could not say
beyond all doubt.

00:30:27.868 --> 00:30:29.836
What will happen now?

00:30:29.995 --> 00:30:31.963
If you take my advice,

00:30:32.122 --> 00:30:32.964
you'll leave.

00:30:33.123 --> 00:30:34.215
Without delay.

00:30:36.126 --> 00:30:37.686
There's a warrant out
for Mark's arrest.

00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:39.759
Dear God!

00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:42.174
Every villager is bound by law
to help in his capture,

00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:44.093
but I don't believe a single one
will do so.

00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:45.761
They'd take his side.

00:30:45.927 --> 00:30:47.019
And rightly so.

00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:48.601
Not against you, Dwight.

00:30:48.764 --> 00:30:51.813
Within a week, he'll be found
and brought to justice.

00:30:51.975 --> 00:30:53.852
It will then be safe
for your return.

00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:56.113
What do you take me for?

00:30:56.271 --> 00:30:57.648
To skulk away to safety

00:30:57.814 --> 00:30:59.782
while the man I wronged
is hunted down like an animal?

00:30:59.941 --> 00:31:01.318
No.

00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:03.613
I'd sooner meet him face to face
and take the consequence.

00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:04.779
Which could be fatal.

00:31:04.905 --> 00:31:06.999
I'll take my chance.

00:31:07.157 --> 00:31:08.454
Besides...

00:31:10.619 --> 00:31:13.463
I cannot leave these people.

00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:15.295
I have been met with nothing
but kindness here,

00:31:15.457 --> 00:31:16.657
and to repay them like this...

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:17.925
No.

00:31:18.085 --> 00:31:22.386
I thank you for your concern,
but I will stay.

00:31:29.513 --> 00:31:32.312
Then your blood be
on your own head.

00:31:33.767 --> 00:31:36.361
Keren's is there already.

00:31:54.496 --> 00:31:56.498
Is it true about Keren?

00:31:56.665 --> 00:31:59.088
Folk are saying
her neck was broke.

00:32:01.128 --> 00:32:02.345
O" Purpose?

00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:03.801
I doubt it.

00:32:03.964 --> 00:32:06.137
But the magistrates
will think otherwise.

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:07.346
And what of Mark?

00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:09.762
The constables are out in force.

00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:12.556
And your admirer, Sir Hugh,
has called in the soldiers.

00:32:12.722 --> 00:32:13.722
HOW?

00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:15.066
They were in the area
looking for smugglers.

00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:18.729
As a magistrate, he has
the power to commandeer them.

00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:20.989
And if Mark is found?

00:32:21.148 --> 00:32:22.695
He'll hang.

00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:25.202
MARK: And well deserve it.

00:32:37.706 --> 00:32:38.832
I killed her.

00:32:41.251 --> 00:32:43.970
I didn't mean to, but I did.

00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:46.348
You know <i>as</i> well as I
she brought him to it.

00:32:46.506 --> 00:32:47.632
Her and Enys.

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:50.393
The courts will never
accept that.

00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:52.805
I must give myself up.

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.188
No!

00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:56.020
I ain't safe.

00:32:56.183 --> 00:32:57.901
If I see Enys,
I'll swing for him,

00:32:58.059 --> 00:32:59.356
as I'll rightly swing for her.

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:00.361
No, Mark.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.817
One life's already lost.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.028
What would it serve
to waste another'?

00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:17.746
If it's to happen,
it must be tonight.

00:33:17.913 --> 00:33:19.005
And from Nampara Cove.

00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:20.916
And in our boat?

00:33:21.082 --> 00:33:24.586
She's not fit for ocean-going
when the seas are rough,

00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:26.801
but a resolute man
could do worse in fair weather.

00:33:26.963 --> 00:33:28.931
And go where?

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:30.467
Ireland?

00:33:30.634 --> 00:33:31.931
Brittany?

00:33:32.093 --> 00:33:34.061
And the oars?

00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:39.273
Might find their way to the cove
after dark,

00:33:39.434 --> 00:33:43.405
together with enough supplies
to keep a man alive.

00:33:45.607 --> 00:33:47.109
'Tisn't lawful.

00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:52.079
No.

00:33:52.239 --> 00:33:56.836
But some might say it is
a kind ofjustice.

00:33:56.993 --> 00:33:59.416
We must keep Mark away
from Dwight.

00:33:59.579 --> 00:34:03.209
We don't want more blood
on his hands.

00:34:18.515 --> 00:34:19.732
Go upstairs and change.

00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:26.902
And prepare to be the lady.

00:34:59.681 --> 00:35:02.480
My dear, this is Captain McNeil.

00:35:02.642 --> 00:35:05.111
Captain McNeil, may I present
my wife, Demelza.

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.318
The pleasure is mine, ma'am.

00:35:09.482 --> 00:35:11.450
Captain Poldark and I
are old comrades.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.284
We were together at James River
in '81.

00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:16.414
Oh, I see.

00:35:16.573 --> 00:35:18.871
I understood he was acquainted
with the murderer,

00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:20.794
and wondered if he could
give me any pointers

00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:22.416
<i>as</i> to where
the felon might hide.

00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:25.002
None that spring to mind.

00:35:25.165 --> 00:35:27.088
Though I don't imagine
he'll linger.

00:35:28.168 --> 00:35:30.296
Any suitable boats hereabouts

00:35:30.462 --> 00:35:32.385
whereby he might make
his escape?

00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:34.220
A few, I suppose.

00:35:34.382 --> 00:35:35.725
I have one myself.

00:35:35.884 --> 00:35:38.137
Where is it kept?

00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:39.725
In a cave down by the shore.

00:35:39.888 --> 00:35:42.311
But it couldn't be handled
by a single man.

00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:44.568
Can I persuade you to stay
for supper, Captain?

00:35:44.726 --> 00:35:46.353
My wife has made kidney pudding.

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:48.692
Another occasion,
I'd be delighted.

00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:50.072
But if you'll oblige me

00:35:50.231 --> 00:35:52.199
by pointing out the coves
hereabouts,

00:35:52.359 --> 00:35:55.203
I could search for the smugglers
and murderer at the same time.

00:35:55.362 --> 00:35:57.239
Two birds with one stone,
you might say.

00:35:57.405 --> 00:35:58.845
May I offer you some brandy,
Captain?

00:35:58.907 --> 00:36:02.036
I trust you'll be able to tell
by the flavor

00:36:02.202 --> 00:36:04.079
whether or not
the duty's been paid.

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:13.213
You were so good.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.008
No one would've guessed
you knew a thing.

00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:17.676
Don't underestimate him.

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:20.220
He's smarter than he looks.

00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:33.282
Now I must fetch the oars.

00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:34.784
Oh, Ross...

00:36:34.943 --> 00:36:36.786
I clean forgot,
this came from Trenwith.

00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:44.081
What does it say?

00:36:44.244 --> 00:36:46.747
"As you may know,
Verity left us yesterday

00:36:46.913 --> 00:36:49.712
"for Captain Blarney.

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:52.047
"They are to be married today.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.507
Elizabeth."

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.093
So she's done it at last.

00:36:56.256 --> 00:36:58.679
I rather feared she might.

00:36:58.842 --> 00:37:00.264
Well, why should they not
be happy together

00:37:00.427 --> 00:37:01.507
if they do love each other?

00:37:01.594 --> 00:37:02.971
Why "As you may know"?

00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:07.104
Why should she think
we would know?

00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:10.111
Well, perhaps the news
is already about?

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:15.195
I must go to Trenwith.

00:37:15.358 --> 00:37:16.484
This letter is abrupt.

00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:17.743
They must be upset.

00:37:19.154 --> 00:37:22.579
I'll call there on my way back
from the cove.

00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:25.335
You'll be well enough here
with Garrick to guard you?

00:37:45.263 --> 00:37:48.142
This is our very first
meal together.

00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:51.903
Does it seem strange to you?

00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:53.153
No.

00:37:55.899 --> 00:37:58.698
'Tis only that in all our lives,

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.783
we've not met more than
two dozen times.

00:38:02.781 --> 00:38:06.035
Tonight, we close the book
on our old lives.

00:38:06.201 --> 00:38:09.705
Tomorrow, we open a new one.

00:38:10.705 --> 00:38:12.548
And write it together.

00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:17.467
If you should ever feel unhappy,
my love,

00:38:17.629 --> 00:38:19.927
I swear...

00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:21.841
it'll not be of my doing.

00:39:36.291 --> 00:39:37.383
Judas!

00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:39.718
You gave me such a fright!

00:39:39.878 --> 00:39:41.380
Forgive me.

00:39:41.546 --> 00:39:43.844
I did not mean...

00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:51.226
Ross counseled me to leave.

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:54.063
For your own safety.

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:56.102
I cannot contemplate
such a thing.

00:39:56.269 --> 00:39:58.647
But I'm sick of my own company
tonight.

00:39:58.813 --> 00:40:00.190
May I avail myself of Ross's?

00:40:00.356 --> 00:40:03.075
He isn't here.

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:05.202
I came as soon I could.

00:40:06.863 --> 00:40:08.206
How's Francis?

00:40:08.364 --> 00:40:10.116
He's half a mind
to go after her.

00:40:10.283 --> 00:40:11.660
Persuade him against.

00:40:11.826 --> 00:40:13.078
He's no match for Blarney.

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:14.461
Or Verity,

00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:16.623
for I think she's now
the bolder of the two.

00:40:16.789 --> 00:40:19.212
Certainly the most reckless.

00:40:19.375 --> 00:40:22.094
She has the courage
of her convictions,

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:25.928
which I applaud even if
I seem to disapprove.

00:40:32.805 --> 00:40:33.897
Well, Ross...

00:40:36.684 --> 00:40:38.607
Are you pleased
with your handiwork?

00:40:40.647 --> 00:40:43.116
Clearly, it was you
who helped her.

00:40:43.274 --> 00:40:44.446
L?

00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:46.077
Arrange Verity's elopement?

00:40:46.235 --> 00:40:47.908
Have you taken leave
of your senses?

00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:54.871
I don't think that Ross
would want you here.

00:40:55.036 --> 00:40:57.084
Have I forfeited
his good opinion?

00:40:57.246 --> 00:40:58.793
Or his trust?

00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:00.755
No, no, it's not that,
it's just...

00:41:00.917 --> 00:41:03.340
<i>He has business tonight,
and maybe visitors.</i>

00:41:07.632 --> 00:41:09.600
I'll see who it is.

00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:10.851
No, no, I must.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.853
'Tis maybe the soldiers.

00:41:13.012 --> 00:41:14.104
Wait here.

00:41:21.062 --> 00:41:22.689
There be soldiers everywhere.

00:41:22.855 --> 00:41:24.295
We couldn't think
where else to come.

00:41:25.692 --> 00:41:27.365
<i>"FRANCE".
You've helped them before.</i>

00:41:27.527 --> 00:41:30.246
You allowed them to meet
secretly at Nampara.

00:41:30.405 --> 00:41:31.531
To my eternal regret.

00:41:31.698 --> 00:41:32.824
You were nearly killed!

00:41:32.991 --> 00:41:34.334
Do you imagine I want
a repetition of that?

00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:36.870
No, no, no, no,
you cannot abide to lose face!

00:41:37.036 --> 00:41:38.162
Francis!

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:39.876
You were defeated then,
and this is your revenge.

00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:41.131
Francis, stop!

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:42.650
I think you must be drunk,
Francis.

00:41:42.709 --> 00:41:44.006
I think you must leave, Ross.

00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:52.931
Ross is down at the cove.

00:41:53.094 --> 00:41:54.266
You can wait in here
till he comes back

00:41:54.429 --> 00:41:55.772
and tells you it's clear.

00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:06.779
Verity could not have managed it
on her own.

00:42:06.941 --> 00:42:08.614
It must be your doing!

00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:11.495
You and that impudent brat
you married!

00:42:11.654 --> 00:42:12.826
Francis!

00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:14.469
You've been using her
to carry letters

00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:15.909
between Verity and that skunk!

00:42:16.075 --> 00:42:18.874
When I say I have not,
I expect to be believed.

00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:22.257
If you continue
to doubt my word...

00:42:22.415 --> 00:42:23.883
Dwight, go back to the kitchen.

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:27.469
<i>"Us a trap."</i>

00:42:27.628 --> 00:42:29.130
'Tis a bloody trap!

00:42:29.297 --> 00:42:30.389
How dare you say that?

00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:33.472
Mark, have you no sense?

00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:35.056
Dwight, go back
into the kitchen.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.436
You bastard...

00:42:36.596 --> 00:42:38.348
You should've come for me.

00:42:38.514 --> 00:42:41.438
Not broken a girl
who couldn't defend herself.

00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:42.727
I'll break ye soon enough!

00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:44.237
Stop this!

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:46.238
Are you mad?!

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:48.570
Do you want to bring
the soldiers down upon us?

00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:51.031
I gave you credit
for more intelligence.

00:42:51.194 --> 00:42:53.288
I gave you credit
for more loyalty.

00:42:53.446 --> 00:42:55.164
But perhaps your choice of wife

00:42:55.323 --> 00:42:56.683
has coarsened
your finer instincts!

00:42:57.617 --> 00:42:59.711
Enough!

00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:05.925
Both of you!

00:43:06.084 --> 00:43:08.382
Have you forgot you are family?

00:43:10.213 --> 00:43:11.760
You would fight and kill
each other in our house?

00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:13.925
Does friendship mean
nothing to you?

00:43:14.092 --> 00:43:15.184
Let me finish him!

00:43:15.343 --> 00:43:16.845
'Tis finished already.

00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:18.183
It isn't, don't you see?

00:43:18.346 --> 00:43:20.644
Dr. Enys can't betray you
without betraying us.

00:43:23.935 --> 00:43:25.061
You can trust him.

00:43:25.228 --> 00:43:28.402
I'd as lief trust a snake.

00:43:28.564 --> 00:43:29.781
What you did is
on your conscience.

00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:30.942
As what I did is on mine.

00:43:32.568 --> 00:43:33.911
You have my word.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.868
I won't betray anyone.

00:44:09.063 --> 00:44:10.861
Call him back, Francis.

00:44:11.023 --> 00:44:12.275
He's your cousin.

00:44:12.441 --> 00:44:14.284
I have no cousin!

00:44:14.443 --> 00:44:16.241
And I have no sister!

00:44:19.157 --> 00:44:22.582
I have a wife, a son,
and an estate

00:44:22.743 --> 00:44:25.087
in considerably less debt today
than it was yesterday.

00:44:27.415 --> 00:44:28.962
So I'm content.

00:44:43.431 --> 00:44:44.853
Ross!

00:44:46.976 --> 00:44:49.229
What in God's name...?

00:44:51.856 --> 00:44:53.153
Go home and sleep.

00:44:53.316 --> 00:44:54.488
And tomorrow...

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:56.869
Tomorrow, I will tend
to my patients

00:44:57.028 --> 00:44:59.656
and try, God knows how,
to make amends.

00:45:40.238 --> 00:45:42.616
I've been hiding down
that old mine of your father's.

00:45:44.075 --> 00:45:44.746
Wheal Grace?

00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:45.626
Wheal Grace.

00:45:45.785 --> 00:45:46.957
Shh!

00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:51.420
To keep from going off my head,
I went all over her.

00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:53.835
There's money in that mine.

00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:55.924
Copper.

00:45:56.087 --> 00:45:58.465
I never see'd
a more keenly load.

00:45:58.631 --> 00:45:59.883
Where is it?

00:46:00.049 --> 00:46:01.676
On the east face.

00:46:01.842 --> 00:46:04.516
'Twill be underwater most times.

00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:06.022
Soldiers!

00:46:12.687 --> 00:46:15.361
I never meant to hurt her, Ross.

00:46:15.523 --> 00:46:17.275
We know that, Mark.

00:46:19.694 --> 00:46:21.287
I must pay for what I've done.

00:47:17.209 --> 00:47:18.335
Get in the boat, Mark!

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:19.924
Mark, get in the boat!

00:47:23.257 --> 00:47:24.509
SOLDIER: This way!

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:25.972
By the surf, there's a boat!

00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:28.058
Mark, take the oars!

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.188
Make haste, make haste!

00:48:02.588 --> 00:48:04.511
Can you see anything?

00:48:04.673 --> 00:48:05.970
Lights in the distance,
heading this way.

00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:07.760
Help me with the boots, quick.

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:15.602
Ross, your hand!

00:48:15.768 --> 00:48:18.362
It must've happened
when I hit the soldier.

00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:19.864
Hide my clothes away, hurry!

00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:25.410
Gently now, love.

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:28.994
Let them knock again
before we make light.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:39.463
Get into bed.

00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:41.298
We mustn't wake Julia.

00:48:53.013 --> 00:48:54.185
Oh, damn it!

00:48:54.348 --> 00:48:56.271
This is a fine time to call!

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:01.397
Mark Daniel escaped.

00:49:03.482 --> 00:49:05.029
Is that certain?

00:49:05.192 --> 00:49:07.820
And in your boat.

00:49:07.987 --> 00:49:10.081
I see.

00:49:10.239 --> 00:49:12.617
You do not seem very distressed.

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:15.753
I'm becoming philosophical
in my old age.

00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:18.790
Not that I'm happy
to lose a good boat,

00:49:18.956 --> 00:49:20.833
but sighing
will not bring it back

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.843
any more than it will bring back
yesterday's youth.

00:49:23.002 --> 00:49:27.052
Your attitude
does you credit, Captain.

00:49:27.214 --> 00:49:31.219
May I, as a man a year or so
your senior,

00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:33.979
offer ye a word of advice?

00:49:34.138 --> 00:49:35.731
By all means.

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:37.267
Have a care for the law.

00:49:37.433 --> 00:49:41.063
'Tis a cranky
and twisty old thing.

00:49:41.228 --> 00:49:44.232
And you may flout it
half a dozen times,

00:49:44.398 --> 00:49:47.402
but let it once
come to grips with ye

00:49:47.568 --> 00:49:49.991
and you'll find it harder
to be loose from

00:49:50.154 --> 00:49:53.784
than a great black squid.

00:49:53.949 --> 00:49:58.329
I'd welcome your assurance that
my advice has been heeded.

00:49:58.496 --> 00:50:01.921
You may rest easy
on that score, Captain.

00:50:02.082 --> 00:50:04.676
In that case, I look forward
to calling upon you

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:06.257
and your charming wife

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.343
when I'm next in the county.

00:50:08.506 --> 00:50:11.100
Have you hurt your hand
somewhere, Captain?

00:50:11.258 --> 00:50:12.350
Oh.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.478
Caught it in a rabbit trap.

00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:06.655
First Jim, now Mark.

00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:11.027
My band of brothers
is shrinking.

00:51:11.193 --> 00:51:14.322
At least Mark got clean away
and McNeil suspected nothing.

00:51:15.823 --> 00:51:17.166
It was a good night in the end.

00:51:18.617 --> 00:51:19.869
Not entirely.

00:51:20.035 --> 00:51:21.958
You forget I went to Trenwith.

00:51:24.123 --> 00:51:26.421
Was it dreadful?

00:51:26.584 --> 00:51:28.757
Suffice it to say
Francis and I have broken.

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:30.136
Possibly for good.

00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:44.955
MAN: A letter for
you, Master Poldark.

00:51:47.646 --> 00:51:49.648
I've been called to a meeting.

00:51:49.815 --> 00:51:51.783
What manner of meeting?

00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:53.615
An extraordinary one, to be
called at such short notice,

00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:54.869
all partners summoned.

00:52:33.275 --> 00:52:35.994
Elizabeth's not down yet.

00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:37.496
'Tis you I wish to see.

00:52:42.326 --> 00:52:43.418
What is it?

00:53:07.559 --> 00:53:10.062
The meeting went well?

00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:12.448
In a word... no.

00:53:12.606 --> 00:53:13.698
Tell me.

00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:15.951
I'd rather hear your news.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.408
I'd rather you did not.

00:53:20.948 --> 00:53:22.541
What happened?

00:53:27.246 --> 00:53:29.374
I went to see Francis.

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.213
What the devil for?

00:53:34.962 --> 00:53:37.135
Did Ross send you?

00:53:37.297 --> 00:53:39.425
Why would he?

00:53:39.591 --> 00:53:41.685
Because he's too craven
to face me himself?

00:53:41.844 --> 00:53:43.096
I came here of my own accord

00:53:43.262 --> 00:53:45.685
to tell you that
you are mistook about Ross.

00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:49.167
He had no hand
in Verity's elopement.

00:53:52.396 --> 00:53:56.401
When I did not believe him,
why would I believe you'?

00:53:56.567 --> 00:53:59.241
Because I know
who did arrange it.

00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:03.992
You've been passing
letters between them

00:54:04.158 --> 00:54:05.535
these last three months?

00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:08.917
Tell me you're joking.

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:12.709
No, <i>Ross,</i> I wish I were, but...

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:15.836
There's more.

00:54:16.003 --> 00:54:19.382
'Twas I who first sought
Captain Blamey out.

00:54:19.548 --> 00:54:21.926
I wanted to see if he still
had feelings for Verity

00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:24.811
or was as wicked
<i>as</i> people did say.

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:28.565
And you were able to divine that
in a single meeting?

00:54:28.724 --> 00:54:30.317
Not in a single meeting.

00:54:32.227 --> 00:54:34.730
I brought them together again.

00:54:34.897 --> 00:54:36.114
I encouraged Verity.

00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:38.947
What have you done?

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:40.577
I don't understand.

00:54:40.736 --> 00:54:44.661
All I did was bring two people
together who loved each other.

00:54:44.823 --> 00:54:47.667
No, Demelza,
that is not all you did.

00:54:47.826 --> 00:54:49.999
I had yesterday a letter

00:54:50.162 --> 00:54:54.292
from the Warleggans' bank,
telling me they could no longer.

00:54:54.458 --> 00:54:55.880
Support my loan

00:54:56.043 --> 00:54:59.468
and that I must make immediate
arrangements to repay it.

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:03.134
I too had such a letter,
word for word.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.474
That's unheard of,
to suddenly withdraw credit.

00:55:06.637 --> 00:55:08.230
I called upon
George Warleggan today

00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:10.561
to ask him to reconsider.

00:55:10.724 --> 00:55:11.724
He declined.

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:14.478
And to me.

00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:15.965
And when I asked him
the reason...

00:55:16.104 --> 00:55:18.607
He suggested you look to your
connection with Carnmore.

00:55:18.774 --> 00:55:20.868
I regret to announce

00:55:21.026 --> 00:55:24.656
that not only do I have no more
capital to contribute...

00:55:26.698 --> 00:55:29.292
I expect any day
to be declared bankrupt.

00:55:29.451 --> 00:55:31.624
For months, you lied to me.

00:55:31.787 --> 00:55:32.834
No.

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:33.997
Gone behind my back.

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:36.508
I thought you'd be angry, but...

00:55:36.667 --> 00:55:37.714
At what?

00:55:37.876 --> 00:55:39.878
Your ignorance?

00:55:40.045 --> 00:55:41.547
Your arrogance?

00:55:43.966 --> 00:55:49.723
Your utter disregard
for truth and consequence?

00:55:49.888 --> 00:55:52.107
All I've done is
make two people happy.

00:55:52.266 --> 00:55:53.984
Oh, Demelza,
do not underestimate

00:55:54.142 --> 00:55:55.894
the scale of your achievement.

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:58.780
What do you mean?

00:56:01.567 --> 00:56:03.911
What now?

00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:06.242
For me?

00:56:07.865 --> 00:56:09.287
Debtors' prison.

00:56:10.576 --> 00:56:12.044
Or the poor house.

00:56:13.912 --> 00:56:17.007
'Twas a glorious scheme.

00:56:17.165 --> 00:56:19.839
And I'll never regret
the impulse behind it.

00:56:20.002 --> 00:56:22.130
But it has cost us dear.

00:56:22.296 --> 00:56:25.470
It has cost us everything.

00:56:25.632 --> 00:56:27.726
Someone has betrayed us.

00:56:27.885 --> 00:56:29.432
Someone close to us.

00:56:31.179 --> 00:56:33.648
How did it end with Francis?

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:40.109
What I did,
perhaps it was wrong,

00:56:40.272 --> 00:56:41.273
but I did it for love of Verity.

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.657
Get out.

00:56:42.816 --> 00:56:45.319
I came here to take the blame,
and so I have.

00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:46.885
Be angry with me,
but not with Ross.

00:56:46.987 --> 00:56:48.147
He had nothing to do with it.

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.873
Will you go?!

00:56:50.032 --> 00:56:52.706
And never enter
this house again!

00:56:55.913 --> 00:56:57.335
And the same goes for Ross.

00:56:57.497 --> 00:57:00.125
If he will marry such
an ignorant trull as you,

00:57:00.292 --> 00:57:02.841
well, then he must take
the consequences.

00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:10.269
<i>"ROSS".
Good men reduced to poverty.</i>

00:57:10.427 --> 00:57:14.352
Their families, our family,
everything we've built.

00:57:14.514 --> 00:57:16.107
Our very lives together!

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:18.394
Now do you understand?

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.483
I have betrayed you.

00:57:20.646 --> 00:57:24.241
And been the cause
of a greater betrayal.

00:57:41.208 --> 00:57:44.052
I've ruined everything?

00:57:44.211 --> 00:57:45.303
And this?

00:57:47.005 --> 00:57:48.552
Have I ruined this too?

00:57:48.715 --> 00:57:50.809
Have I lost your trust?

00:57:50.968 --> 00:57:52.515
Is it forever?

00:57:55.055 --> 00:57:56.307
It is.

00:57:56.473 --> 00:57:58.350
I can see it in your eyes.

00:57:58.517 --> 00:58:01.896
Can I ever win it back?

00:58:03.063 --> 00:58:04.565
I don't know.

00:58:06.274 --> 00:58:09.027
I'd be lying if I said I did.

00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:15.288
You've married into a peculiar
family, Demelza.

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:21.583
We Poldarks are hasty,
sharp tempered,

00:58:21.748 --> 00:58:23.967
strong in our likes
and dislikes.

00:58:28.213 --> 00:58:31.137
Perhaps yours was the more
reasonable view.

00:58:31.299 --> 00:58:33.499
If two people love each other,
why shouldn't they marry?

00:58:33.552 --> 00:58:35.020
And be damned
to the consequences.

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:36.304
I only meant to help.

00:58:36.471 --> 00:58:38.189
I know that.

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:39.941
I know you could not
have foreseen.

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.943
Can you forgive me?

00:58:47.899 --> 00:58:49.025
I will try.

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:51.615
But Francis will not.

00:58:53.071 --> 00:58:54.163
No.

00:58:54.322 --> 00:58:55.699
And you will not forgive him,

00:58:55.866 --> 00:58:59.712
and I have caused a rift between
the two sides of our family.

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:01.918
Yes.

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.378
I will never be happy
until it is healed.

00:59:21.767 --> 00:59:25.522
Then I'm afraid you'll be
unhappy for a very long time.

00:59:38.832 --> 00:59:48.832
