00:00:44.172 --> 00:00:48.688
DEMELZA: # Mem'ries like
voices that call on the wind

00:00:49.052 --> 00:00:53.807
# Medhel an gwyns, medhel an gwyns

00:00:54.172 --> 00:00:58.450
# Whispered and tossed
on the tide coming in

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:02.644
# <i>Medhel, oh medhel an gwyns</i>

00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:08.208
# <i>Songs like the dreams</i>
<i>that the bal maidens spin</i>

00:01:08.812 --> 00:01:13.488
# <i>Medhel an gwyns, medhel an gwyns</i>

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:17.764
# <i>Weaving the song of the cry of the tin</i>

00:01:18.532 --> 00:01:22.525
# <i>Medhel, oh medhel an gwyns</i>

00:01:23.332 --> 00:01:28.008
# <i>Voices like songs that
are heard in the dawn</i>

00:01:28.052 --> 00:01:32.842
# <i>Medhel an gwyns, medhel an gwyns</i>

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:37.727
# <i>Singing the secrets of children unborn</i>

00:01:37.772 --> 00:01:41.811
# <i>Medhel, oh medhel an gwyns</i>

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.648
Does he think 'ee can buy
we off with fag ends?

00:01:48.514 --> 00:01:49.153
Hush, you black worm.

00:01:50.064 --> 00:01:55.089
Cap'n Ross already be looking after we by
turning a blind eye to us living in his barn.

00:01:56.114 --> 00:01:58.372
- Do he know we live here?
- Course he do.

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:02.156
Bless him for it and you too.

00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:06.561
And curse 'ee! You miserly mongrel!

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:11.278
- Ooh, I could leather the arse off him.
- ( Chuckles)

00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:17.717
( Bell tolling)

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:27.813
It's an impressive operation,
the smelting works on Trevaunance's land.

00:02:27.917 --> 00:02:31.910
Hm. Though it's difficult, I imagine,
without any actual copper.

00:02:31.957 --> 00:02:35.393
Yes, pity it will shortly
no longer be required.

00:02:35.437 --> 00:02:37.632
Their mines produce a fraction
of what's needed.

00:02:37.677 --> 00:02:39.952
At the last four auctions they were outbid.

00:02:39.997 --> 00:02:45.754
If they get no more copper at the next auction,
well, surely that will be death knell for Carnmore.

00:02:46.157 --> 00:02:51.999
Were I Sir John Trevaunance I might regret
having a brand-new smelting works on my land

00:02:52.425 --> 00:02:55.622
and my money invested...
with nothing to produce.

00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:19.716
You should go, dear.
Kate'll be wanting you.

00:03:22.761 --> 00:03:26.674
- How is the child, Jinny?
- She's better, Cap'n Poldark, sur.

00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:29.235
Doctor Enys says
it is not the putrid throat, after all.

00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:31.717
- That's a mercy.
- 'Tis, sur.

00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:34.610
Only this week there's
three dead of it in Sawle.

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:38.369
Here. Take these for you and Jim's mother.

00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:42.722
I'm that glad to serve 'ee again, ma'am.
I know you can scarce afford me.

00:03:42.773 --> 00:03:45.526
Jinny, if we did what we could afford
we wouldn't get out of bed.

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:51.124
( Julia grizzling)

00:03:54.013 --> 00:03:57.369
- She has a new tooth coming.
- Soon she'll be able to bite like Garrick.

00:03:57.413 --> 00:03:59.051
( Chuckles)

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:03.244
What's this?

00:04:04.693 --> 00:04:06.923
It's from Verity.

00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.571
AUNT AGATHA: When will Verity be home?

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.971
FRANCIS: This is not Verity's home.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.731
My throat's afire.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.611
Get Mrs Tabb to fetch me a posset.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.453
She's unwell. All the servants are unwell.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.817
I'm not unwell.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.011
93 and the appetite of a girl of 20.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.393
If Verity were here
she'd prescribe honey and liquorice.

00:04:50.403 --> 00:04:54.521
- Doctor Choake prescribes leeches.
- I've no faith in Doctor Choake.

00:04:54.564 --> 00:04:57.920
No, nor I. And even less in Verity.

00:05:02.284 --> 00:05:04.752
Verity seems content.

00:05:05.644 --> 00:05:08.112
So your experiment ended well.

00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:12.435
And yours?

00:05:12.964 --> 00:05:14.955
Carnmore?

00:05:15.564 --> 00:05:18.386
Our hopes are pinned on tomorrow's auction.

00:05:19.671 --> 00:05:22.360
We've scraped together
enough capital to bid high.

00:05:23.047 --> 00:05:25.686
If we get sufficient copper we'll survive.

00:05:26.767 --> 00:05:29.565
If we had more capital
we'd stand a better chance.

00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:32.925
I wish to help. Let me help.

00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:35.037
We could raise a mortgage on Nampara.

00:05:35.087 --> 00:05:36.315
Already raised.

00:05:37.767 --> 00:05:40.076
You could sell my brooch and my best frock.

00:05:40.127 --> 00:05:45.201
By no means. We're not yet so desperate
that I must steal the gown off your back.

00:05:45.247 --> 00:05:49.081
But I would feel better
if I could somehow make amends.

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:58.991
I'll be home tomorrow.
Tonight I'll stay at the Red Lion.

00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:03.526
It'll go well at the auction.
You'll win all your bids.

00:06:04.648 --> 00:06:07.606
Get all the copper you need
and Carnmore will be safe.

00:06:09.608 --> 00:06:11.599
- DEMELZA: Wave.
- ( Horse whinnies)

00:06:37.808 --> 00:06:41.624
- You're wasting away.
- I've no time for feasting.

00:06:42.828 --> 00:06:44.978
Since Keren's death
you take no care of yourself.

00:06:45.028 --> 00:06:48.623
Since her husband's exile
I try to care for those he left behind.

00:06:50.028 --> 00:06:51.780
You've had word of him.

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:54.501
Safe and well in France
with no plans to return.

00:06:54.988 --> 00:06:57.422
So you may cease to lash yourself
into a frenzy of work.

00:06:57.468 --> 00:06:59.902
May I, with this latest epidemic?

00:06:59.948 --> 00:07:02.860
- The putrid throat.
- I'm struggling to contain it.

00:07:02.908 --> 00:07:05.382
Whole families have gone under.

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:09.894
- If the poor were better fed and housed...
- It's no respecter of privilege.

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:12.055
Choake has been summoned to Trenwith.

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.451
Who has it there?

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:16.057
All of them, I believe.

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:18.294
- Can you not call?
- They're Choake's patients.

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:20.330
He'd resent my interference.

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:24.452
Besides, I lay no claim to a cure. Sometimes
the weak survive and the strong go under.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:41.232
Stand aside, Mr Poldark.
We are on urgent business.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.582
I won't detain you.
I came to enquire after the family.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.700
Is it the putrid throat?

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.706
Morbus Strangulatorius?

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.741
What fool gave you that idea?

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.148
We have isolated the symptoms, we have applied
remedies, and they are all on the mend.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.709
- So soon?
- 'Tis merely a question of competent treatment.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.581
They'll be up and about in no time.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.107
Oh...

00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:30.335
( Francis coughs)

00:09:19.135 --> 00:09:22.207
I have next to dispose of a dole of ore
from United Mines.

00:09:22.255 --> 00:09:28.854
50 tons. Sold to the South Wales Smelting
Company for seven pounds, 16 shillings a ton.

00:09:33.975 --> 00:09:35.806
Do you want some bread?

00:09:35.855 --> 00:09:37.652
Hm?

00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:40.332
( Footsteps, door opens)

00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:43.166
'Ee've heard the news from Trenwith?

00:09:44.015 --> 00:09:45.243
Tell me.

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:51.113
Wheal Busy. Parcel of red copper, 45 tons.

00:09:56.519 --> 00:10:01.354
Sold to the South Wales Smelting Company
for eight pounds, four shillings a ton.

00:10:02.599 --> 00:10:06.228
All the servants ill? Not
one fit to tend them?

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:09.908
And Doctor Choake called away to Truro.
And not back till morning.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:16.058
Wheal Leisure, 40 tons.

00:10:22.663 --> 00:10:25.894
Wheal Leisure is sold to
the South Wales Smelting Company

00:10:25.942 --> 00:10:28.615
for seven pounds, 19 shillings.

00:10:30.342 --> 00:10:34.017
And that concludes the auction for today.
Thank you, gentlemen.

00:11:00.662 --> 00:11:02.459
( Sighs)

00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:09.105
If I'm not back by nightfall, see Julia's
milk boiled and that she's put to bed.

00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:13.988
Are we all that remain?

00:11:15.992 --> 00:11:18.506
The Warleggans have been most efficient.

00:11:21.632 --> 00:11:25.575
I call to order this meeting
of the Carnmore Copper Company.

00:11:25.775 --> 00:11:27.766
Proceed, sir.

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:34.012
I have to report that today, yet again,
we got no copper.

00:11:35.775 --> 00:11:38.335
Since the prospect seems
unlikely to change...

00:11:38.375 --> 00:11:39.933
We bow to the inevitable.

00:11:39.975 --> 00:11:45.176
It is with extreme regret that I declare

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.103
the Carnmore Copper Company dissolved.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.732
Ross. You're becoming a hermit.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.796
Margaret was only saying how much
she's missed you at our gaming parties.

00:12:03.116 --> 00:12:07.394
- I've no time for cards these days.
- Cousin Matthew will be sad to hear that.

00:12:08.916 --> 00:12:11.589
You know Margaret's on her third lord.
( Chuckles)

00:12:11.636 --> 00:12:15.717
I don't know how
but she sucks the life out of her lovers.

00:12:16.477 --> 00:12:20.072
- Her instinct for survival is voracious.
- And you should know.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:23.546
She told me she once had
a fancy to marry you.

00:12:24.437 --> 00:12:27.190
- Not you?
- Oh, my sights are set somewhat higher.

00:12:29.837 --> 00:12:31.828
And how's your wife?

00:12:31.877 --> 00:12:35.711
She was much remarked on at the last ball.
You should bring her out more.

00:12:35.757 --> 00:12:39.466
- We've no time for socialising, George.
- The smelting company keeps you busy?

00:12:39.517 --> 00:12:41.473
- Wheal Leisure.
- Ah, yes.

00:12:41.517 --> 00:12:45.226
One of the few mines which still
offer prospects for the investor.

00:12:45.277 --> 00:12:48.553
I believe some shares
are shortly coming on to the market.

00:12:49.917 --> 00:12:51.669
And whose are they?

00:12:51.717 --> 00:12:53.833
Oh, I... I understood them to be yours.

00:12:55.157 --> 00:12:57.352
But perhaps I was misinformed.

00:12:57.877 --> 00:12:59.868
You were.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.541
AUNT AGATHA: Verity?

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.707
- Is that you?
- No, it's Demelza.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.741
Ross' little bud.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.100
I came to enquire after the family.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.268
They're sick, every last jack of 'em.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.029
And who's to care for
'em, with Verity gone?

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.857
She'd no business to go. Her duty's here.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:39.736
'Twas a selfish, cruel thing she did
to leave us like that.

00:14:40.897 --> 00:14:42.888
( Coughing)

00:14:48.497 --> 00:14:52.172
GEORGE: It goes without saying
I would offer a generous price.

00:14:52.217 --> 00:14:55.926
I have no control over my partners.
You could approach one of them.

00:14:56.817 --> 00:14:58.808
What is it that offends you, Ross?

00:15:00.017 --> 00:15:04.932
That we Warleggans have dared to drag ourselves
out of poverty and aspire to gentility?

00:15:04.977 --> 00:15:08.555
Poverty doesn't offend
me, nor does aspiration.

00:15:08.823 --> 00:15:13.294
But you are mistaken if you think greed and
exploitation are the marks of a gentleman.

00:15:13.343 --> 00:15:17.461
You know, one of these days, you'll find
yourself without means, without colleagues,

00:15:17.503 --> 00:15:20.700
without friends,
and with no one to blame, but yourself.

00:15:22.743 --> 00:15:24.973
Good day to you, George.

00:15:28.703 --> 00:15:30.694
( Gulls cry)

00:15:50.023 --> 00:15:52.253
( Indistinct conversation)

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.398
Demelza.

00:16:14.886 --> 00:16:17.002
I came to see if I could help.

00:16:18.046 --> 00:16:21.322
Oh. That's very kind of you.

00:16:24.846 --> 00:16:26.438
I'm in despair.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:30.676
My poor little boy.

00:16:32.246 --> 00:16:34.237
He has these spasms.

00:16:34.286 --> 00:16:37.195
Then he vomits, and there's relief.

00:16:38.339 --> 00:16:41.092
But only for a time, and
then it begins again.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.933
You're sick yourself, Elizabeth.
You ought to be in bed.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.971
I cannot leave my boy.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.771
I'll stay with him.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.575
I'll stay and look after you all.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.089
( Sobs)

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.097
The man imagined
he could drive up copper prices.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.812
( Chuckling)

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.933
- And get a fairer deal for the mines.
- GEORGE: And so he did.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.653
Until we became wise and outbid him.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.691
And now?

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.171
His smelting works stand idle.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:24.391
- The price of copper will fall again.
- He'll be left with enormous debts.

00:17:25.061 --> 00:17:27.211
And no obvious means to discharge them.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.574
Perhaps he will throw
himself upon your mercy.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.694
He may try. Hm.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.651
Excuse me.

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:50.595
It must be galling to have nothing but
debt to show for 12 months of hard labour.

00:17:51.243 --> 00:17:55.759
Bad enough... to see your assets
now in enemy hands.

00:17:59.043 --> 00:18:02.592
The smelting works on Trevaunance's land?

00:18:03.643 --> 00:18:04.962
What did you hear?

00:18:05.243 --> 00:18:09.666
That Sir John, after battling
against the wind for months...

00:18:10.563 --> 00:18:12.554
is now preparing to sail with it.

00:18:13.683 --> 00:18:15.514
By selling to the Warleggans?

00:18:15.563 --> 00:18:17.554
He must cover his losses.

00:18:17.603 --> 00:18:19.878
( Sighs) While the rest of us go bankrupt.

00:18:40.338 --> 00:18:42.693
If the servants hadn't been so ill...

00:18:44.578 --> 00:18:47.650
But Doctor Choake said
half the village is down.

00:18:47.698 --> 00:18:50.132
Ssh. You ought to rest.

00:18:50.578 --> 00:18:52.569
( Moans)

00:18:52.618 --> 00:18:55.257
- Who is it?
- Demelza.

00:18:56.498 --> 00:18:58.295
She's come to help us.

00:18:58.338 --> 00:19:02.775
It's good of her to...
overlook past quarrels.

00:19:04.298 --> 00:19:06.095
Hm.

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:11.524
So my own debts...
in addition to the mortgage on Nampara?

00:19:13.703 --> 00:19:15.580
Around 900 pounds.

00:19:17.023 --> 00:19:19.014
More than I feared.

00:19:19.063 --> 00:19:20.781
You have assets.

00:19:21.423 --> 00:19:23.015
My shares in Wheal Leisure.

00:19:23.063 --> 00:19:26.817
I was approached only yesterday
by a man named Cole, with a good offer.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.778
One that could clear all your debts.

00:19:29.823 --> 00:19:31.302
For all of my shares?

00:19:31.343 --> 00:19:33.777
I got the impression he'd go even higher.

00:19:34.383 --> 00:19:38.695
Oh, he would.
On behalf of his master, George Warleggan.

00:19:40.863 --> 00:19:44.139
As you once remarked:
Beggars cannot be choosers.

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.094
But this time I can.

00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:50.601
The Warleggans have a habit
of buying up mines and closing them down

00:19:50.902 --> 00:19:53.462
just to suppress competition
to their own holdings.

00:19:53.501 --> 00:19:55.890
I'll be damned
if I let that happen to Wheal Leisure.

00:19:56.661 --> 00:19:57.935
So?

00:19:58.941 --> 00:20:01.091
So...

00:20:01.141 --> 00:20:04.770
I require capital of 1,000 pounds.

00:20:05.861 --> 00:20:07.852
Without security.

00:20:08.141 --> 00:20:09.938
( Chuckles)

00:20:21.581 --> 00:20:23.378
( Sizzling)

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.571
Here. It will ease the rawness.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.091
Will he die?

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.091
Not if I can help it.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.258
Any luck?

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.298
Would I call it that?

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:20.265
To saddle a man with a 12-month loan,
at interest of 40 per cent?

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.141
I urge you to reconsider.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:24.543
Start again.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.707
Rather than plunge in so deep
there might be no getting out.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.239
I'll take my chance.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.349
- The odds are against you.
- I know it.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:38.944
And should I doubt it, the sight of Matthew
Sanson parading about like a prize cockerel...

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.259
Permitted to trade and socialise
as if his integrity were not in tatters.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.187
Who's to gainsay him?

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.620
The Warleggans
are complete masters of the district.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.864
- And the ship?
- The Queen Charlotte.

00:21:52.422 --> 00:21:54.492
Their latest venture.

00:21:54.542 --> 00:21:58.854
- They seem pleased with her.
- They consider her their flagship enterprise.

00:21:59.623 --> 00:22:01.614
And themselves unassailable.

00:22:18.983 --> 00:22:21.497
You shouldn't be out alone at dusk.

00:22:21.943 --> 00:22:24.059
Poverty breeds desperate men.

00:22:32.903 --> 00:22:34.894
You have news?

00:22:35.343 --> 00:22:37.334
It will keep.

00:22:45.068 --> 00:22:47.059
There's sickness at Trenwith...

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:52.860
Geoffrey Charles had it worst.

00:22:53.268 --> 00:22:55.463
But I believe the crisis has passed.

00:22:55.508 --> 00:22:57.464
That's a relief.

00:22:57.508 --> 00:23:02.218
I may never forgive Francis, but I would not
wish the putrid throat to my worst enemy.

00:23:03.908 --> 00:23:06.024
- Ross?
- Yes?

00:23:07.028 --> 00:23:10.020
I swore I would never keep secrets
from you again.

00:23:11.861 --> 00:23:13.453
And so?

00:23:15.941 --> 00:23:18.136
I went to Trenwith.

00:23:20.061 --> 00:23:22.655
- But they turned you away?
- No.

00:23:23.021 --> 00:23:25.535
- I stayed all last night.
- Oh, in God's name!

00:23:25.581 --> 00:23:28.095
Ross, I had to. They were all so sick.

00:23:28.461 --> 00:23:30.816
Even the servants.
They had no one to tend them.

00:23:30.861 --> 00:23:33.295
And Geoffrey Charles was so weak.

00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:35.332
Twice I thought I him gone.

00:23:36.823 --> 00:23:39.496
But this morning he brought round and...

00:23:40.223 --> 00:23:42.134
Doctor Choake says the worst is now over.

00:23:42.183 --> 00:23:45.892
- I cannot believe you would do such a...
- What would you have done?

00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:48.851
What did you do? For Jim Carter.

00:23:54.023 --> 00:23:56.014
You're right.

00:23:57.411 --> 00:24:03.281
It was a kind and generous act. Perhaps in a
fortnight I'll be in the mood to appreciate it.

00:24:06.971 --> 00:24:08.962
( Thunder rumbles)

00:24:11.291 --> 00:24:13.088
( Baby wailing)

00:24:17.411 --> 00:24:19.402
( Baby wailing)

00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:24.722
( Wailing continues)

00:24:32.793 --> 00:24:36.069
- DEMELZA: Sssh.
- Put on a gown or you'll catch a chill.

00:24:36.113 --> 00:24:38.343
I'm hot. 'Tis she that is cold.

00:24:40.033 --> 00:24:42.263
- Bring her to bed.
- ( Julia continues wailing)

00:24:42.313 --> 00:24:44.304
Sssh. Sssh.

00:24:53.899 --> 00:24:56.413
My throat is dry. I'll get some water.

00:25:01.699 --> 00:25:03.690
Sssh.

00:25:11.299 --> 00:25:13.290
What is it?

00:25:13.339 --> 00:25:15.057
My throat is swollen.

00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:20.168
You have a rash.

00:25:36.499 --> 00:25:38.490
( Thunder crashes)

00:25:42.949 --> 00:25:44.940
( Door opens)

00:26:21.687 --> 00:26:24.838
They both have it.
The symptoms are unmistakable.

00:26:26.126 --> 00:26:28.117
How bad will it be?

00:26:28.686 --> 00:26:30.358
If they get through the night...

00:26:30.886 --> 00:26:32.877
Dear God.

00:26:33.166 --> 00:26:35.760
- Surely...
- There's no reliable treatment.

00:26:37.126 --> 00:26:38.525
What can I do?

00:26:41.509 --> 00:26:42.703
Pray.

00:26:47.469 --> 00:26:49.619
( Moaning and panting)

00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:20.660
Sssh, sssh.

00:27:20.709 --> 00:27:23.098
- Can you hear me, my love?
- ( Moans)

00:27:23.429 --> 00:27:26.949
Can you hear me? Demelza?

00:27:29.266 --> 00:27:31.257
Try to drink this. Just a sip.

00:27:31.306 --> 00:27:33.661
- She won't take it.
- Her fever's worsening.

00:27:33.706 --> 00:27:35.697
Can you save her?

00:27:36.906 --> 00:27:38.578
( Panting)

00:27:41.986 --> 00:27:45.456
TOM CARNE:
<i>Saved? Are ye saved, daughter?</i>

00:27:46.346 --> 00:27:47.904
Are ye saved?

00:27:47.946 --> 00:27:49.823
( Distorted) Are ye saved?

00:27:49.946 --> 00:27:52.744
( Distorted) Saved? From what?

00:27:52.786 --> 00:27:55.300
An impudent troll like that.

00:27:55.346 --> 00:27:58.816
- You must get her to drink something.
- TOM: Drink is the devil's work.

00:27:59.786 --> 00:28:05.188
Turn away, daughter.
Come home and live a clean and pure life.

00:28:06.408 --> 00:28:09.559
- There's little more I can do.
- ROSS: You must fight, my love.

00:28:10.448 --> 00:28:15.283
- You must fight.
- TOM: Fight me? Fight me? Come on, then.

00:28:15.328 --> 00:28:16.522
Come on!

00:28:16.568 --> 00:28:19.958
Corn. We must have corn. How else
are we meant to feed our starving children?

00:28:20.008 --> 00:28:21.999
15 shillings a bushel.

00:28:22.328 --> 00:28:24.319
15 shillings and not a penny less.

00:28:24.368 --> 00:28:27.246
Demelza, do not underestimate
the scale of your ignorance.

00:28:27.288 --> 00:28:30.864
Your arrogance, your utter disregard
for truth and consequence.

00:28:31.465 --> 00:28:34.775
She's failing. She's failing.

00:28:35.585 --> 00:28:39.180
- What can I do?
- ELIZABETH: Let go, my dear. Let go.

00:28:39.785 --> 00:28:42.663
I'll take care of Ross.
You know he would rather be with me.

00:28:42.705 --> 00:28:44.900
<i>You know he would rather be with me</i>.

00:28:45.345 --> 00:28:46.983
<i>You know he would rather be with me</i>.

00:28:54.785 --> 00:28:56.776
( Thunder rumbles)

00:29:09.854 --> 00:29:11.845
Forgive me.

00:29:14.054 --> 00:29:16.614
Forgive me, I cannot save her.

00:29:18.934 --> 00:29:20.925
( Julia grizzles)

00:29:22.494 --> 00:29:24.485
I will stay with her.

00:29:26.494 --> 00:29:28.485
I would not have her be afraid.

00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:52.478
Julia...

00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:57.186
Poldark will not be
bothering us for a while.

00:31:57.231 --> 00:31:59.222
Because?

00:31:59.391 --> 00:32:01.268
He'll be otherwise engaged.

00:32:01.511 --> 00:32:03.820
( Clears his throat) With what?

00:32:05.711 --> 00:32:07.827
His daughter's burial.

00:32:15.391 --> 00:32:17.382
( Birdsong)

00:32:19.831 --> 00:32:21.822
( Footsteps)

00:32:26.764 --> 00:32:29.961
- You should try to rest.
- Should have provided for them.

00:32:31.644 --> 00:32:32.146
Who?

00:32:33.644 --> 00:32:35.396
It's custom after the burial.

00:32:35.444 --> 00:32:38.993
The winter's been savage. The least
I could have done was fed and watered them.

00:32:39.044 --> 00:32:41.478
Who would expect it?
They know of Demelza's illness.

00:32:41.524 --> 00:32:45.881
- Everything I touch is cursed.
- You cannot believe that.

00:32:45.924 --> 00:32:47.676
- So many came.
- Yes.

00:32:47.724 --> 00:32:50.185
- So many...
- They care for you.

00:32:53.484 --> 00:32:55.793
I should have provided for them.

00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:21.137
There's no change - for
better or for worse.

00:33:21.189 --> 00:33:23.180
You should take some air.

00:33:23.589 --> 00:33:25.580
And then sleep.

00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:19.060
( Wind whistles)

00:34:47.916 --> 00:34:51.113
The maiden voyage of the Queen Charlotte...

00:34:52.196 --> 00:34:54.790
The demise of the Carnmore
Copper Company...

00:34:55.676 --> 00:34:57.871
and its chief architect.

00:35:04.956 --> 00:35:06.753
( Thunder rumbles)

00:35:17.156 --> 00:35:19.226
Something amiss?

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:24.388
Far from it. Today I omitted
to provide for the mourners.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.108
Now that will be remedied.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.905
Jud! Jud, wake up!

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.784
God damn if a man's not king of his own...

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.548
There's a wreck, Jud.

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:44.206
- Where? Where's she...?
- Hendrawna beach.

00:35:44.316 --> 00:35:46.705
Go rouse the others -
Sawle and Marasanvose!

00:35:46.755 --> 00:35:50.191
- Why bring it to all they?
- She's a prize of a ship carrying food.

00:35:50.235 --> 00:35:53.193
They'll be pickings for all. Zacky! Zacky.

00:35:53.235 --> 00:35:54.827
Hendrawna beach. There's a wreck.

00:35:54.875 --> 00:35:56.866
- Paul, go rouse the village.
- What is she?

00:35:56.915 --> 00:36:00.703
Brigantine. Grain aboard, pilchards.
Enough to fill your bellies for a month.

00:36:00.755 --> 00:36:02.746
How do you know?

00:36:02.795 --> 00:36:04.786
I know who owns her.

00:36:04.835 --> 00:36:06.826
Yaaargh! Yaargh!

00:36:19.355 --> 00:36:21.346
( Chatter)

00:36:39.231 --> 00:36:42.621
How long will we wait?
My gizzards is rumbling.

00:36:42.671 --> 00:36:44.423
You'll be fed soon enough.

00:36:44.471 --> 00:36:46.268
Paul, Zacky, get the fires going.

00:36:46.311 --> 00:36:49.508
Tell the women to form a line
and keep the children clear.

00:37:00.511 --> 00:37:02.741
Hellfire and damnation.

00:37:06.231 --> 00:37:09.813
- It cannot be.
- Hendrawna beach. Isn't that...

00:37:10.017 --> 00:37:11.416
Poldark land.

00:37:26.817 --> 00:37:28.808
( Ross calls out)

00:37:50.174 --> 00:37:53.723
Feed the children first.
They'll be plenty for all later.

00:38:08.334 --> 00:38:11.212
( Grunts) These people should hang.

00:38:11.614 --> 00:38:13.730
Give me a rope, I'll do it myself.

00:38:13.774 --> 00:38:16.083
- Captain Bray must testify.
- To what?

00:38:16.134 --> 00:38:19.809
To the plunder and lawlessness.
No, better still... Matthew.

00:38:20.054 --> 00:38:23.808
- He can testify against Poldark.
- Always assuming he witnesses.

00:38:23.854 --> 00:38:25.845
Whether he witnesses or not!

00:38:25.894 --> 00:38:29.364
Good God, boy, you don't suggest
we wait for actual evidence?

00:38:29.854 --> 00:38:34.430
Matthew is a gentleman.
He's a Warleggan.

00:38:35.169 --> 00:38:38.366
Worth two of any Poldarks
and his word will carry twice the weight.

00:38:38.409 --> 00:38:42.721
And I'll be damned if we don't turn
this debacle to our advantage!

00:38:51.969 --> 00:38:53.960
( Chatter and shouting)

00:39:25.569 --> 00:39:27.560
( Chatter and laughter)

00:39:36.529 --> 00:39:38.326
( Laughter)

00:39:57.059 --> 00:40:00.210
- Do we think he'll be there?
- If the reports are true...

00:40:00.259 --> 00:40:03.535
- If his daughter...
- He may not be in the mood for plunder.

00:40:04.859 --> 00:40:07.373
- And then again, he may.
- And if he is?

00:40:07.419 --> 00:40:09.649
He'll be caught in the act.

00:40:12.659 --> 00:40:16.049
Cap'n Ross! Cap'n Ross.

00:40:16.739 --> 00:40:19.128
- They be coming from 'Luggan.
- Who?

00:40:19.179 --> 00:40:21.010
Why, the blatherin' miners.

00:40:21.059 --> 00:40:26.804
They saw the boat up from the cliff
and followed it round the coast to here.

00:40:27.156 --> 00:40:28.973
They'll be wanting a piece of her,
that's for certain.

00:40:29.441 --> 00:40:31.750
We'll give 'em a basting!
We did it once, we can do it again.

00:40:31.802 --> 00:40:33.713
'Tis a cold lot, they are, though.

00:40:33.762 --> 00:40:36.879
'Tis said they'll leave a man drowned
just to have the shirt off his back.

00:40:36.922 --> 00:40:39.390
Tidn', right, tidn' fit,
tidn' fair, tidn' proper.

00:40:39.442 --> 00:40:41.717
'Tis our beach, 'tis our bounds.

00:40:42.162 --> 00:40:45.040
Clear as much cargo
as we can before they arrive.

00:40:45.122 --> 00:40:47.590
Once they're here it will
be out of our hands.

00:40:52.802 --> 00:40:56.511
It's mine, it's mine. She's mine!
I'll not be parted from her.

00:40:58.442 --> 00:40:59.511
( Groans)

00:41:03.452 --> 00:41:04.646
The situation is grave.

00:41:04.692 --> 00:41:08.002
I'm given to understand there's a serious
risk to the passengers and crew.

00:41:08.052 --> 00:41:10.850
- From drowning, sir?
- From the rabble on the beach.

00:41:10.892 --> 00:41:13.087
And since many of the passengers
are gentlemen,

00:41:13.132 --> 00:41:16.010
in particular my own cousin Matthew.

00:41:16.052 --> 00:41:17.770
And then there's the matter of the cargo.

00:41:17.812 --> 00:41:21.327
'Tis generally accepted that what's washed
ashore is property of the finder.

00:41:21.372 --> 00:41:26.127
It is the property of the Warleggans and
anyone plundering will be guilty of theft.

00:41:26.172 --> 00:41:28.163
And committing a capital offence.

00:41:32.732 --> 00:41:34.484
I'm certain we understand each other.

00:41:38.631 --> 00:41:40.622
Indeed we do, sir.

00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:50.622
I had hoped...

00:41:52.711 --> 00:41:55.305
I could have sworn she'd come round by now.

00:41:55.351 --> 00:41:57.342
Will she yet, do you think?

00:41:57.671 --> 00:41:59.662
I wish I could know for certain.

00:42:04.312 --> 00:42:06.906
You should go, Jinny.
Help your family at Hendrawna.

00:42:06.952 --> 00:42:08.943
( Knocking at door)

00:42:17.272 --> 00:42:19.263
( Door opens)

00:42:20.712 --> 00:42:22.703
( Footsteps)

00:42:24.752 --> 00:42:26.265
I'll be off now, sir.

00:42:27.952 --> 00:42:30.944
- Who's at the door?
- Someone to look after mistress.

00:42:48.746 --> 00:42:51.174
The miners be here, Ross.
Far end of the beach.

00:42:52.266 --> 00:42:54.575
Go home. Make the women and children safe.

00:42:54.626 --> 00:42:56.617
Keep your doors shut and bolted.

00:42:56.666 --> 00:42:59.055
Nay! I'll budge for no man.

00:42:59.626 --> 00:43:01.457
'Tis our cove, 'tis our pickings.

00:43:01.506 --> 00:43:05.215
Let them strip the vessel if they choose.
We've had the best of her.

00:43:06.386 --> 00:43:10.174
Take him home. Before his mouth gets him
into mischief it can't talk him out of.

00:43:10.226 --> 00:43:13.579
Yes, Mr Ross. God bless you, Mr Ross.

00:43:14.364 --> 00:43:17.356
- Survivors, Ross. Been washed ashore.
- Where?

00:43:17.404 --> 00:43:19.554
Far side of the beach,
coming in on the tide.

00:43:19.604 --> 00:43:22.198
They won't last long
with 'Luggan's finest to greet 'em.

00:43:22.244 --> 00:43:24.838
- Get everyone off the beach now.
- What will 'ee do?

00:43:24.884 --> 00:43:26.875
See what I can do for the survivors.

00:43:32.324 --> 00:43:34.315
( Shouting)

00:43:45.844 --> 00:43:47.835
( Shouting and screaming)

00:43:49.684 --> 00:43:51.675
( Shouting)

00:44:20.164 --> 00:44:22.155
( Screaming and shouting)

00:44:28.164 --> 00:44:30.155
( Distorted shouting)

00:44:39.764 --> 00:44:41.755
( Distorted shouting)

00:44:46.694 --> 00:44:48.764
MAN: Help! Help!

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:52.451
( Groans)

00:44:53.054 --> 00:44:55.045
Help!

00:44:55.854 --> 00:44:57.651
Hey!

00:45:05.494 --> 00:45:07.007
( Coughing and spluttering)

00:45:20.494 --> 00:45:22.485
Sanson.

00:46:08.729 --> 00:46:11.243
Keep your distance, man. We are armed.

00:46:12.089 --> 00:46:13.841
I was about to offer you shelter.

00:46:14.849 --> 00:46:16.362
Who are you?

00:46:16.409 --> 00:46:19.719
My name is Poldark. I have a house nearby.

00:46:20.889 --> 00:46:24.359
- Have you no control over these savages?
- None whatsoever.

00:46:24.409 --> 00:46:26.559
It's a disgrace!

00:46:26.609 --> 00:46:31.664
Two years ago I was shipwrecked off
Patagonia and treated less barbarously!

00:46:32.496 --> 00:46:35.533
Perhaps the natives were better fed
than these miners.

00:46:35.576 --> 00:46:37.567
Fed? If it were only food!

00:46:38.616 --> 00:46:43.132
But all of our cargos has been pillaged and
we ourselves barely escaped with our lives.

00:46:43.176 --> 00:46:47.642
- It's monstrous.
- There is much in this world which is monstrous.

00:46:48.056 --> 00:46:50.490
Those who prefer not to freeze to death
follow me.

00:46:50.536 --> 00:46:52.527
How do we know it's not a trap?

00:46:55.296 --> 00:46:56.888
You'll have to take my word for it.

00:46:58.157 --> 00:47:00.148
The word of a gentleman?

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:14.949
I must get word to Mr Warleggan.

00:47:14.997 --> 00:47:17.716
He's already apprised, sir.
It was he who dispatched us.

00:47:17.757 --> 00:47:20.225
You'll set about reclaiming our goods
from this rabble?

00:47:20.277 --> 00:47:22.791
Never fear, sir. We'll soon restore order.

00:47:22.837 --> 00:47:25.226
- I wouldn't count on it.
- I have my orders.

00:47:25.277 --> 00:47:27.268
Then at least wait until daylight.

00:47:27.437 --> 00:47:30.554
These people are fighting drunk
and quarrelling among themselves.

00:47:30.597 --> 00:47:34.192
- Interfere and they'll turn on you.
- But if we fired into them?

00:47:34.237 --> 00:47:36.228
Not half of you will come out alive.

00:47:47.737 --> 00:47:52.253
Pardon me, gentlemen, but may I ask
for quietness, my wife is seriously ill.

00:47:58.737 --> 00:48:01.774
- Ross. You're back.
- These men survived the wreck.

00:48:01.817 --> 00:48:05.412
- They will need your attention.
- Forgive me, I was trying to sleep.

00:48:05.457 --> 00:48:09.156
- ( Clears his throat)
- The news with Demelza?

00:48:26.422 --> 00:48:28.652
I was too weak to come to the funeral.

00:48:29.943 --> 00:48:33.697
- But hearing she might still be in danger...
- There's no need.

00:48:40.623 --> 00:48:43.535
- She saved my child.
- Yes.

00:48:44.983 --> 00:48:46.974
And lost yours in return.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.912
- Oh, Ross, if I could do anything that would...
- You can.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.716
You can pray to God
I do not lose the love of my life.

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.431
Of course.

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.589
Come back, my love. Come back.

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.271
ROSS: ( Whispers) Come on...

00:49:32.849 --> 00:49:34.840
Has she come to take you?

00:49:35.489 --> 00:49:37.366
No.

00:49:37.409 --> 00:49:39.639
No, my love. She will never take me.

00:49:49.529 --> 00:49:51.520
( Gulls cry)

00:49:51.569 --> 00:49:53.560
( Low chatter)

00:50:16.447 --> 00:50:18.438
I was sorry to hear of your loss.

00:50:21.727 --> 00:50:23.922
The world is a darker place without her.

00:50:24.687 --> 00:50:26.678
And a brighter one without him.

00:50:27.247 --> 00:50:29.238
Could you have saved him?

00:50:31.247 --> 00:50:33.283
Why would I wish to?

00:50:33.327 --> 00:50:35.522
- Common decency.
- He showed none.

00:50:37.687 --> 00:50:42.220
You insist that we are enemies
when, in fact, we have much in common.

00:50:42.407 --> 00:50:44.284
And could be allies.

00:50:44.327 --> 00:50:46.443
God forbid I should ever be desperate.

00:51:05.432 --> 00:51:07.423
- Where's Julia?
- Sssh.

00:51:09.552 --> 00:51:12.669
You've been asleep a long while.
There was a shipwreck.

00:51:13.352 --> 00:51:15.866
- Where?
- On Hendrawna beach.

00:51:17.632 --> 00:51:19.623
I've never seen a wreck.

00:51:25.552 --> 00:51:27.543
Where's Julia?

00:51:45.592 --> 00:51:47.583
( Sobs)

00:51:52.989 --> 00:51:56.061
- When I was not with her.
- I was.

00:51:59.789 --> 00:52:03.099
Could you tell that she was leaving us?
Was she afraid?

00:52:03.149 --> 00:52:05.344
She was peaceful.

00:52:07.749 --> 00:52:10.183
I held her in my arms.

00:52:10.229 --> 00:52:12.220
Oh, Ross.

00:52:14.989 --> 00:52:16.980
( Sobs)

00:53:06.852 --> 00:53:09.286
That upstart is here again.

00:53:11.932 --> 00:53:14.571
I really cannot face him.

00:53:18.052 --> 00:53:22.568
- Let him be told we're not yet recovered.
- I will make our excuses.

00:53:44.692 --> 00:53:47.316
Forgive my intrusion.

00:53:48.155 --> 00:53:53.309
I was returning from the wreck. No doubt
you heard my cousin Matthew perished.

00:53:53.355 --> 00:53:55.664
I wish there was some
consolation I could offer.

00:53:56.435 --> 00:53:58.426
There is.

00:54:04.275 --> 00:54:06.584
These are strange times, Elizabeth.

00:54:07.435 --> 00:54:09.995
We should no longer stand on ceremony.

00:54:11.035 --> 00:54:13.105
If you say so.

00:54:13.155 --> 00:54:15.828
Sooner or later we must all declare.

00:54:16.835 --> 00:54:19.319
For one side or another.

00:54:20.606 --> 00:54:22.597
For which side do you declare?

00:54:22.646 --> 00:54:24.637
For no side.

00:54:25.366 --> 00:54:28.119
At least... for no man.

00:54:33.206 --> 00:54:36.084
- You must not say this to me, George.
- Oh, I must.

00:54:37.486 --> 00:54:39.204
And I do.

00:54:39.246 --> 00:54:45.127
I will no longer have my feelings
misunderstood. Or my intentions.

00:54:49.194 --> 00:54:51.071
I bid you good day, Elizabeth.

00:55:08.874 --> 00:55:10.865
( Sobs)

00:55:14.154 --> 00:55:16.065
( Footsteps)

00:55:25.034 --> 00:55:27.025
I wish...

00:55:27.794 --> 00:55:30.388
- I wish...
- What do you wish?

00:55:35.354 --> 00:55:37.993
I wish I had a chance to say goodbye.

00:56:09.149 --> 00:56:14.064
Geoffrey Charles is well.
We must take heart from that.

00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:17.340
Can you?

00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:22.340
And so must you.

00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:26.540
Will you make it up with Francis?

00:56:28.509 --> 00:56:30.500
Even though he betrayed us?

00:56:37.449 --> 00:56:39.440
You make me ashamed.

00:56:40.729 --> 00:56:42.720
Your heart is so generous.

00:56:44.289 --> 00:56:46.280
You always see the good in things.

00:56:51.009 --> 00:56:53.762
I will invite him to join
me at Wheal Leisure.

00:56:55.089 --> 00:56:58.877
Together we try to resurrect
the fortunes of the Poldark mines.

00:57:01.729 --> 00:57:03.720
Will that satisfy you?

00:57:07.129 --> 00:57:09.949
So there is hope.

00:57:12.047 --> 00:57:14.481
And it will not have been
for nothing, after all.

00:57:28.527 --> 00:57:30.324
( Sobs)

00:57:53.943 --> 00:57:55.740
Captain Poldark?

00:57:55.783 --> 00:57:58.297
I have orders to take you to Truro Jail.

00:57:58.343 --> 00:58:00.174
On what charge?

00:58:00.223 --> 00:58:02.691
Wrecking. Inciting a riot.

00:58:02.743 --> 00:58:05.132
- Murder.
- There's a mistake!

00:58:05.183 --> 00:58:07.253
You cannot believe it. Ross, tell him!

00:58:07.303 --> 00:58:09.373
Who accuses me?

00:58:11.063 --> 00:58:13.054
Who accuses me?

00:58:16.103 --> 00:58:18.094
George.

00:58:47.943 --> 00:58:54.576
# I'd pluck a fair rose for my love

00:58:54.743 --> 00:59:00.181
# I'd pluck a red rose blowing

00:59:01.023 --> 00:59:04.140
# Love's in my heart

00:59:04.183 --> 00:59:07.493
# A-trying so to prove

00:59:08.223 --> 00:59:14.059
# What your heart's knowing
